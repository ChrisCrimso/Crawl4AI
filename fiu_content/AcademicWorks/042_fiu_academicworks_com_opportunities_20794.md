### Doctoral Evidence Acquisition (DEA) Fellowship
**Doctoral Evidence Acquisition ( DEA) Fellowship Guidelines – Fall 2025**
The Doctoral Evidence Acquisition (DEA) Fellowship is specifically intended to support doctoral students for whom their current means of financial support would significantly interfere with or preclude their ability to collect the evidence needed for their doctoral research.* A DEA Fellow is awarded a stipend to enable evidence acquisition that otherwise would not be possible. *Evidence acquisition activities that might be supported by the DEA Fellowship include, but are not limited to, off-campus library/archive research, fieldwork, experiments, interviews, collection of specimens, etc.
Applicants should submit their complete application by **11:59pm on Sunday, June 1, 2025.**
**Eligibility Requirements**
To be eligible for consideration for a DEA, applicants must:
  * Be currently enrolled for a minimum of three (3) dissertation credits
  * Have reached doctoral candidacy at the time of this Fellowship application (Doctoral Degree and Application for Candidacy approved by UGS in Spring 2025 or earlier)
  * Have dissertation proposal approved with UGS, or be in the process of submitting the proposal to UGS in Summer 2025 (If awarded, an approved dissertation proposal is required)
  * Full-time students who will be in the program for more than four years at the time of receiving the award (students who will be in their 13th term or beyond in Fall 2025) are not eligible to apply. If you were admitted in Fall 2021 or earlier, you are not eligible to apply.
