## SALC/Student-Athlete Development
![SAAC 2024-25](https://fiusports.com/images/2024/12/11/CAL01182.jpg)
**Mission**
The FIU Student-Athlete Leadership Council (SALC) is committed to the mission of Conference USA and National Student-Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC). We strive to provide a forum for student-athletes to express ideas, concerns, and opinions relating to NCAA and Conference legislation as well as other issues that affect their welfare and experiences at FIU. We value maintaining a positive environment that fosters a healthy relationship between athletic administration and student-athletes and provide an environment that values diversity and gender equity among student-athletes. We value giving back through community outreach and this year's initiative is to "foster the youth", as we partner with our neighboring elementary school with initiatives throughout the year.

**Student-Athlete Development Program** Our comprehensive Student Athlete Development programs are designed to support student-athletes in their personal, academic, and professional growth. Through three key pillars— Empowerment & Well-Being, Leadership & Professional Development, and Financial Literacy & Future Planning—we provide the tools and resources needed for success both during and after their athletic careers. **EMPOWERMENT & WELL-BEING** We are dedicated to supporting student-athletes in their mental health and overall well-being. This includes providing access to counseling services, stress management techniques, mindfulness practices, and education on mental health awareness. We focus on assisting student-athletes in exploring their personal identity and values through workshops, reflective exercises, and mentorship programs, fostering self-awareness and purpose-driven goals. By prioritizing wellness and self-care, we support student-athletes in achieving peak performance and overall wellness.
_**Examples of the programs we provide:**_ Transitioning Out of Sports How Marijuana Impacts Athletic Performance Calming Your Body: Stress Reduction Techniques
**LEADERSHIP & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT** We aim to empower student-athletes to lead effectively by teaching them essential communication, decision-making, and teamwork skills. Additionally, we provide support for career readiness and professional development, including workshops, internships, networking events, and career counseling. This ensures student-athletes can develop critical skills such as interview preparation and job search strategies, equipping them for success in their chosen careers. We also emphasize the importance of networking and effective communication to further enhance their professional growth. Examples of the programs we provide: 
  * Academy of Leaders Program
  * Careers in Sports Panel
  * Mock Madness: Interview Prep

**FINANCIAL LITERACY & FUTURE PLANNING** We provide a wide range of programs and resources aimed at enhancing financial literacy, cultivating responsible financial habits, and planning for future goals. We also prepare our student-athletes for the financial responsibilities and challenges they may encounter after graduation, covering topics such as repaying student loans, retirement basics, and planning for major life milestones such as buying a car or home. By establishing knowledge, skills, and resources, we empower our student-athletes to make informed decisions and achieve financial independence with confidence and resilience. Examples of the programs we provide: 
  * Preparing for Finances After College
  * Avoiding Emotional Spending
  * Establishing Credit & Staying Out of Debt

**CAMPUS & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT** At FIU, we believe that transformative education extends beyond the classroom. Our student-athletes are committed to fostering engagement through a diverse array of events and initiatives that connect us to our communities and elevate our collective mission. Participation in signature events such as ROARthon, the Out of Darkness Walk, and Relay for Life showcases our dedication to social responsibility, uniting Panthers in their pursuit of meaningful change. FIU student-athletes contribute to the local community by volunteering at local elementary schools, organizing toy drives, and supporting youth in little leagues. They also engage in adaptive sports initiatives, ensuring that individuals with varying physical and developmental abilities have access to inclusive athletic experiences. **SENIOR TRANSITION PROGRAM** The Senior Transition Program prepares graduating student-athletes for their transition from college to the next phase of their lives. Graduates are not just prepared for the workforce, but informed and empowered to make strategic decisions about their future. Upon completion of the requirements, graduating student-athletes will be eligible to receive a complimentary business suit to enhance their professional appearance for interviews and workplace settings.

**Dr. Paul D. Gallagher Community Service Award**
This award is named for Dr. Gallagher, who was instrumental in the development of the athletic department and the establishment of the football program at FIU. This award recognizes the team that has accumulated the most community service points. Points are calculated by dividing the total number of completed community service hours and the total number of student-athletes on the team. Through this point system small teams can fairly compete against larger teams. Rankings are updated monthly and the final winner is announced at the annual Athletic Academic Awards Banquet.
**The process for requesting student-athlete(s) for community service:**
Complete the [**online request form**](https://fiusports.com/documents/2019/4/19//SA_Panther_GOLD_Form_RARA_Updated_.pdf?id=8562) at least two weeks prior to request date.
The request will be electronically submitted to compliance for approval of the request.
You will be contacted by the Assistant Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Development and Community Relations with notice of approval/denial.
The Assistant Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Development and Community Relations will work to accommodate your request; however please keep in mind student-athletes have challenging schedules and we may not be able to fulfill your request.
As a reminder, there are several NCAA guidelines to which we must adhere. These include limiting participation to events within 30 miles of FIU and restricting involvement with students to those in the eighth grade or younger (6th grade and below for basketball).
**Examples of approved activities for student-athletes:**
Visit schools, grades k-8 (starting Fall 2011 grades k-6th for basketball)
Visit hospitals
Participate in non-profit agency's events
**Examples of activities that cannot be approved for student-athletes:**
