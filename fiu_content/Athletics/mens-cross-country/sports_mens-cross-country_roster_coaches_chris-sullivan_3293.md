Chris Sullivan enters his third year as an assistant coach with the FIU track and field program.
Sullivan ended his career as an FIU athlete as one of the most decorated pole vaulters in school history. He qualified for the 2017 NCAA Outdoor Championships in his senior season, finishing 19th in the nation to conclude the season.
Sullivan primarily works with the multis, jumps, and pole vaulters.
Under his guidance, Clarrisa Cutliff reached the NCAA Indoor and Outdoor Championships, in addition to capturing six individual conference championships in the high jump.
In the 2020 indoor season, he guided freshman Filippa Miller to a school record in the pole vault at the Houston G5-Super 22 Invitational.
