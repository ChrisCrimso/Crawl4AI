**MIAMI** – The FIU baseball porgram dropped the opening game of its weekend series against the Liberty Flames, falling 4-2 on Friday night at FIU Baseball Stadium.
It was a tightly contested pitcher's duel early on, with FIU (26-24, 9-12 CUSA) taking a 1-0 lead in the second inning thanks to a solo home run from [Austin Dearing](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/austin-dearing/11326) — his fourth of the season — sent the opposite way.
Liberty (28-23, 8-14 CUSA) responded with a pair of runs in the fourth, but FIU quickly answered in the fifth as [Brylan West](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/brylan-west/11334) crushed a no-doubt solo shot — his 10th of the season — off the bat at 109 mph to tie the game at 2-2.
The Flames regained the lead in the eighth inning with back-to-back home runs and held on from there to secure the win.
On the mound, [Easton Marks](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/easton-marks/13001) turned in another impressive performance, tossing seven strong innings while allowing just one earned run and striking out eight — tying his career-high for innings pitched. [Juan Villarreal](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/juan-villarreal/13010) was tagged with the loss (6-4), giving up the go-ahead runs in the eighth despite notching two strikeouts. [Tracen Cameron](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/tracen-cameron/11317) closed out the ninth with a scoreless frame and two punchouts.
At the plate, both Dearing and West recorded multi-hit games, while [Cole Cleveland](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/cole-cleveland/12991) and [Javier Crespo](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/javier-crespo/12992) added base hits. [Kishon Frett](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/kishon-frett/11327) extended his on-base streak to 33 consecutive games. **_UP NEXT_** FIU prepares for game two of the series on Saturday, May 10.
