**MIAMI** â€“ The FIU baseball program launched three home runs en route to a dominant 10â€“4 win over Liberty on Saturday at FIU Baseball Stadium.
The Panthers (27â€“24, 10â€“12 C-USA) picked up their 23rd home victory of the season, the most in a single season since 2014. A win on Sunday would clinch a spot in the Conference USA Championship, set to take place in Lynchburg, Virginia.
FIU wasted no time flexing its power at the plate. In the second inning, [Javier Crespo](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/javier-crespo/12992) blasted a 417-foot, two-run homer to left fieldâ€”his third of the seasonâ€”to give the Panthers an early 2â€“0 lead.
Liberty (28-23, 8-15 CUSA) responded with a run in the third, but the Panthers answered in a big way. [Andrew Ildefonso](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/andrew-ildefonso/11332) ripped a two-run double into left-center field, scoring [Cole Cleveland](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/cole-cleveland/12991) and [Kishon Frett](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/kishon-frett/11327). Later in the inning, [Austin Dearing](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/austin-dearing/11326) homered in his second consecutive game, going the opposite way for his fifth of the season.
Frett kept the momentum rolling into the fourth, smashing a two-run shot to deep center fieldâ€”his conference-leading 19th home run of the yearâ€”to extend the lead to 8â€“1.
The Flames scored two in the fifth, but FIU added a pair of insurance runs. Dearing came home on a passed ball, and [Brendan Roney](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/brendan-roney/11315) added a sacrifice fly to center to make it 10â€“3. Liberty added the fourth run in the eighth before FIU set them down to earn the win
On the mound, [Jarek Woodward](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/jarek-woodward/13012) made his fourth start of the season and earned the win, tossing a season-high 4.1 innings while allowing four hits, three earned runs, and recording two strikeouts. [Jaydon Bishop](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/jaydon-bishop/11323) provided 3.1 solid innings of relief, giving up one run with three strikeouts. [Bryce Turner](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/bryce-turner/13007) closed it out, extending his scoreless streak to 8.1 innings with 1.1 no-hit innings and three strikeouts.
Offensively, the Panthers racked up eight hits. [Brylan West](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/brylan-west/11334) posted his third straight multi-hit game, while Frett extended his on-base streak to 34 games. Cleveland, Crespo, Dearing, Ildefonso, and Alec Ulloa each contributed a hit. **_UP NEXT_** FIU prepares for the home finale on Sunday, May 11 at Noon.
