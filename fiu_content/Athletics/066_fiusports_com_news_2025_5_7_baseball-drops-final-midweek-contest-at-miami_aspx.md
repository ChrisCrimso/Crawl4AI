**CORAL GABLES, Fla.** – The FIU baseball program came up short in its final midweek matchup, falling 10–6 to Miami on Wednesday night at Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field.
The Hurricanes (30–18) jumped out to an early lead with back-to-back home runs in the first inning, then extended it to 3–0 with a triple in the third.
FIU (26–23) responded in the fourth, getting on the board with an RBI groundout from freshman [Adonys Velez](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/adonys-velez/13009) that scored [Javier Crespo](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/javier-crespo/12992). [Cole Cleveland](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/cole-cleveland/12991) followed with an infield RBI single to second base, cutting the deficit to 3–2.
Miami added three more runs in the bottom of the fourth and another in the sixth to take a 7–2 lead.
The Panthers battled back in the seventh, starting with a solo home run from Cleveland, who launched a 109 mph shot to right. With runners on the corners later in the inning, Crespo ripped a two-run double into the left-center gap to make it a 7–5 game.
[Brylan West](https://fiusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/brylan-west/11334) brought FIU within one in the eighth with an RBI single, but the Hurricanes answered in the bottom half with a three-run homer to seal the 10–6 win.

At the plate, FIU recorded 13 hits, led by four-hit performances from Cleveland and Crespo.
