## Felsberg Field at FIU Softball Stadium 
**![](https://fiusports.com/images/2023/1/17/FELSBERG_FIELD_vs_FSU_03262022_-_0737.jpg)Prohibited Behavior:** Unruly, threatening, or disruptive behavior such as standing in the aisles, profane and abusive language, smoking, fighting, throwing objects and drunkenness will not be tolerated and can result in ejection, arrest, and/or loss of ticket privileges. Should you observe any of this disruptive behavior, please notify your nearest security or law enforcement officer. Standing on seats/bleachers is strictly prohibited. Artificial noisemakers are not permitted in Felsberg Field for FIU Softball home games per Conference USA. Such items will be removed immediately. Signs of a derogatory nature directed toward individual players, teams, staff, spectators or game officials are not permitted. Stadium procedures prohibit fans from entering the field of play unless they are properly credentialed. Violators are subject to ejection and/or arrest. **FIU Athletics Clear Bag Guidelines:** In the interest of public safety and following the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security (NCS4) Best Practices Guide, FIU Athletics will implement clear bag guidelines effective August 2017. The guidelines, which are part of a growing trend at professional and collegiate sporting venues across the country and consistent with all major sporting venues here in South Florida, will start with the 2017-18 competition season and will include all FIU athletic facilities that host ticketed events: Riccardo Silva Stadium (football), Ocean Bank Convocation Center (men's and women's basketball, volleyball), FIU Soccer Stadium (men's and women's soccer), FIU Baseball Stadium (baseball), and Felsberg Field (softball). Each ticket holder, including children, may carry one approved clear bag, such as a one-gallon clear plastic storage bag (Ziplock bag or similar), plus a small purse about the size of a hand. The following bags will be permitted inside FIU athletic facilities and are subject to search. - Clear plastic bag that does not exceed 12" by 6" by 12". - Clutch or small purse, with or without a strap that does not exceed 6.5" by 4.5". - Equipment bag for necessary medical items. - Diapers and wipes can be carried in a clear bag for age-appropriate children accompanied by an adult. Prohibited bags include, but are not limited to: large purses, coolers, briefcases, backpacks, fanny packs, mesh bags, or any bag larger than the permissible size. Tinted or printed-pattern plastic bags are not clear, so they will not be permitted. Fans can wear or carry items such as binoculars, hand-held electronic devices and cameras (with lenses shorter than four inches) without carrying cases. Fans may carry in seat cushions that will be screened upon entry. FIU is committed to maintaining a safe environment at all athletic events. This is an important step in achieving that. For more information about these new guidelines please visit www.fiusports.com.
**Prohibited Items:** Items prohibited from all FIU athletic events include: any outside food/beverages, illegal drugs, playing balls, umbrellas, pets (except for certified service dogs for disabled patrons), bottles, cans, flasks, thermoses, ice bags, ice chests, coolers, picnic baskets, boom boxes, firearms, incendiary devices (fireworks, smoke bombs, etc.), artificial noisemakers, musical instruments, flag poles, confetti, weapons, hover boards, laser pointers, drone-type aircraft or any item deemed hazardous by FIU Stadium management personnel.
Those with illegal drugs or incendiary devices are subject to ejection and/or arrest.
Authorities are allowed to inspect patrons, and their bags, upon entering any FIU athletic facility for the purpose of spectator safety.
No backpacks will be allowed into FIU athletic events.
Baby strollers need to be kept clear of all aisle ways and must be checked upon entering the Stadium.
All items (packages) are subject to search.
No sitting in the aisles. No standing on the bleachers/seats.
Ushers will restrict entrance to the field and premium areas allowing only credentialed personnel access.
FIU staff reserves the right to prohibit any additional items. **Parking** Guest parking for Felsberg Field is located in Lot 10 which is located NW of the Ocean Bank Convocation Center.
