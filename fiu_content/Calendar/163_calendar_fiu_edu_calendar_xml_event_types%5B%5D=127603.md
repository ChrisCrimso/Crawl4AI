Members of the United States Congress from each party solidify friendships off the floor and on the field. Over the last century, the Congressional Baseball Game’s popularity has contributed to its evolution into a foundation called Congressional Sports for Charity. Created in 2016, Congressional Sports for Charity provides support to worthy and effective charities serving vulnerable children and families in the Washington DC area as well as scholarships to deserving local youth. These charities include the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Philanthropies along with the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund in gratitude to the brave officers at the Republican practice shooting on June 14, 2017.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). They brought together a team of women Members of Congress to play the female campaign staff from both parties after Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her own battle with breast cancer. In 2010, the Members asked the women of the Washington, D.C. press corps to join the game as the opponent and a lasting rivalry was born. The Congressional Women’s Softball Game has raised more than $3.7M for Young Survival Coalition (YSC) since the Game began and has become a staple of Capitol Hill summer activities. 
YSC is the premier global organization dedicated to the critical issues unique to young adults who are diagnosed with breast cancer. They offer resources, connections and outreach so young adults feel supported, empowered and hopeful. Breast cancer is something few young women ever think will happen to them – and certainly not at such an early age. When faced with a diagnosis, they may feel confused, angry and isolated. YSC is a place where young adults can go to find a circle of support and the best information available to navigate their treatment and their lives.
