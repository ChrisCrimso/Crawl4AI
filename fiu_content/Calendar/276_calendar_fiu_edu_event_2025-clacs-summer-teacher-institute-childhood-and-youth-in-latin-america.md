This three-day program will examine the experience of childhood in Latin America, as well as the institutions, practices, and conditions that have shaped the lives of children in the region. We will consider topics like school policy, youth movements, migration experiences, health and economic factors, and cultural views of children over time. The institute will feature a variety of expert presentations (speakers may include university faculty, journalists, and non-profit leaders), and allow participants time to collaboratively discuss ways to incorporate this material in their existing curriculum.
Should you need an ADA accommodation to participate in a university event, program, or activity or need to request materials in an accessible format, please contact FIU’s Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA) at or . All requests for ADA accommodation or accessible materials for this event must be submitted to CRCA at least seven (7) business days prior to the event or at the earliest possible opportunity.
