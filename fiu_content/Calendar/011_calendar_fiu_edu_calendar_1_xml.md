This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021. The original manuscript circulated in the XIX century and was an influence on the island and abroad. The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years prior to the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836.

This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021. The original manuscript circulated in the XIX century and was an influence on the island and abroad. The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years prior to the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830 who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island. 
GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.

Every year, VOC commemorates what happened on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese Communist Party crushed a massive pro-democracy movement by sending tanks into Tiananmen Square. Beijing has since erased all mention of June 4 from its history. We still do not know the death toll.

Members of the United States Congress from each party solidify friendships off the floor and on the field. Over the last century, the Congressional Baseball Game’s popularity has contributed to its evolution into a foundation called Congressional Sports for Charity. Created in 2016, Congressional Sports for Charity provides support to worthy and effective charities serving vulnerable children and families in the Washington DC area as well as scholarships to deserving local youth. These charities include the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Philanthropies along with the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund in gratitude to the brave officers at the Republican practice shooting on June 14, 2017.

As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida. 
The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/>

The program features five award-winning short films—Tifi, La Vie, Konpa, Boat People, and Prestige—that reflect on personal and national histories shaping Haitian communities across generations. Following the screening, a lecture will delve into the lived and cultural experiences that inspired each film. The event concludes with Sinema Chat, a dynamic, audience-driven dialogue where viewers engage directly with the filmmaker in an open, conversational format. This unique approach invites deeper reflection on migration, resilience, and the power of storytelling in the Haitian experience. 
GUEST SPEAKER: Al’ikens Placher is a filmmaker from Haiti. His films have won various awards and screened at a variety of festivals, including winning an HBO BEST SHORT FILM award, having both a world premiere in competition at TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL, and an OSCAR-QUALIFIED short film.
In Haitian Creole. Part of LACC’s Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) Lecture Series and LACC’s Haitian Studies Program of Excellence. Made possible with support from LACC’s US Department of Education Title VI Grant.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). They brought together a team of women Members of Congress to play the female campaign staff from both parties after Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her own battle with breast cancer. In 2010, the Members asked the women of the Washington, D.C. press corps to join the game as the opponent and a lasting rivalry was born. The Congressional Women’s Softball Game has raised more than $3.7M for Young Survival Coalition (YSC) since the Game began and has become a staple of Capitol Hill summer activities. 
YSC is the premier global organization dedicated to the critical issues unique to young adults who are diagnosed with breast cancer. They offer resources, connections and outreach so young adults feel supported, empowered and hopeful. Breast cancer is something few young women ever think will happen to them – and certainly not at such an early age. When faced with a diagnosis, they may feel confused, angry and isolated. YSC is a place where young adults can go to find a circle of support and the best information available to navigate their treatment and their lives.

<title>May 20, 2025: The Bayonet and the Quill: Poland and Haiti in the Script of 1805 at MBUS - SoA Miami Beach Urban Studios</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Set in the Design Gallery alongside the Creole Archive Project: Poloné Nwa - Constitution 1805 exhibition, this thought-provoking panel discussion brings together Haitian-born American artist Edouard Duval-Carrié and FIU’s Ratcliffe Art + Design Incubator Director and Professor of Art + Art History Jacek Kolasiński. The conversation delves into the complex history and cultural legacy of the 1805 alliance between Polish legionnaires and Haitian revolutionaries. Through art, archival research, and storytelling, the discussion offers insight into a little-known chapter of global resistance and solidarity during Haiti’s fight for independence.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/the-bayonet-and-the-quill-poland-and-haiti-in-the-script-of-1805">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+The+Bayonet+and+the+Quill%3A+Poland+and+Haiti+in+the+Script+of+1805&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+May+20%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ASet+in+the+Design+Gallery+alongside+the+Creole+Archive+Project%3A+Polon%C3%A9+Nwa+-+Constitution+1805+exhibition%2C+this+thought-provoking+panel+discussion+brings+together+Haitian-born+American+artist+Edouard+Duval-Carri%C3%A9+and+FIU%E2%80%99s+Ratcliffe+Art+%2B+Design+Incubator+Director+and+Professor+of+Art+%2B+Art+History+Jacek+Kolasi%C5%84ski.+The+conversation+delves+into+the+complex+history+and+cultural+legacy+of+the+1805+alliance+between+Polish+legionnaires+and+Haitian+revolutionaries.+Through+art%2C+archival+research%2C+and+storytelling%2C+the+discussion+offers+insight+into+a+little-known+chapter+of+global+resistance+and+solidarity+during+Haiti%E2%80%99s+fight+for+independence.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fthe-bayonet-and-the-quill-poland-and-haiti-in-the-script-of-1805%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>May 21, 2025: Cuba’s Eternal Night at RDB - Rafael Diaz-Balart Law Building</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>What has become of Cuba since the historic protests of July 11, 2021—and the regime’s swift and brutal crackdown? Cuba’s Eternal Night follows 5 Cubans over 2 harrowing years as they struggle with government repression, scarcity of food and medicine, and the biggest mass exodus the island has ever experienced. Yet amidst the darkness, these five individuals choose to share their lives, boldly and on camera, offering a rare and intimate look inside a nation unraveling. <br /> <br />Jordan Allott is a documentary filmmaker and founder of In Altum Productions (IAP). His work explores themes ranging from international human rights and American politics to Catholic spirituality. <br /> <br />Yoe Suárez is an award-winning journalist and writer. He was an independent journalist in Cuba during the filming and became the film´s field producer. He now lives in the U.S. <br /> <br />Father Alberto Reyes Pías is a Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Camagüey, Cuba. He is one of the most articulate and courageous voices on freedom in Cuba today. <br /> <br />This event is free and open to the public. It will be held in Spanish.

<title>May 29, 2025: Language, Culture and Society in Havana in 1830 at GL - Green Library</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years before the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830, who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island.</p> <p>GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.</p> <p>This event is co-sponsored by the Kimberly Green Latin America and Caribbean Center and FIU Libraries. This event is made possible with the support of LACC's Department of Education Title VI Grant.

<title>May 29, 2025: Language, Culture, and Society in Havana in 1830 at GL - Green Library</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dictionaries and encyclopedias from Europe inspired a group of intellectuals in Havana to compile the typical voices of Cuba around 1830. This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021.

<title>May 29, 2025: Language, Culture, and Society in Havana in 1830 at GL - Green Library</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dictionaries and encyclopedias from Europe inspired a group of intellectuals in Havana to compile the typical voices of Cuba around 1830. This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021. The original manuscript circulated in the XIX century and was an influence on the island and abroad. The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years prior to the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830 who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island. </p> <p> </p> <p>GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.</p> <p> </p> <p>This event is co-sponsored by the Kimberly Green Latin America and Caribbean Center and FIU Libraries. This event is made possible with the support of LACC's Department of Education Title VI Grant. This event is free and open to the public. This event will be conducted in Spanish.

<title>Jun 4, 2025: 2025 Tiananmen Sqaure Massacre Candlelight Vigil at Intersection of Massachusetts and New Jersey Avenues and G Street, NW</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Join VOC on June 4 at the Victims of Communism Memorial to honor the legacy of the brave individuals who stood for freedom at our annual Tiananmen Square Massacre candlelight vigil.</p> <p>Every year, VOC commemorates what happened on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese Communist Party crushed a massive pro-democracy movement by sending tanks into Tiananmen Square. Beijing has since erased all mention of June 4 from its history. We still do not know the death toll.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/2025-tiananmen-sqaure-massacre-candlelight-vigil">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+2025+Tiananmen+Sqaure+Massacre+Candlelight+Vigil+&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+4%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AJoin+VOC+on+June+4+at+the+Victims+of+Communism+Memorial+to+honor+the+legacy+of+the+brave+individuals+who+stood+for+freedom+at+our+annual+Tiananmen+Square+Massacre+candlelight+vigil.%0A%0AEvery+year%2C+VOC+commemorates+what+happened+on+June+4%2C+1989%2C+when+the+Chinese+Communist+Party+crushed+a+massive+pro-democracy+movement+by+sending+tanks+into+Tiananmen+Square.+Beijing+has+since+erased+all+mention+of+June+4+from+its+history.+We+still+do+not+know+the+death+toll.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2F2025-tiananmen-sqaure-massacre-candlelight-vigil%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jun 11, 2025: Congressional Baseball Game at Nationals Park</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Since 1909 the Congressional Baseball Game has been an annual bipartisan event beloved by all and enjoyed by thousands. Members of the United States Congress from each party solidify friendships off the floor and on the field. Over the last century, the Congressional Baseball Game’s popularity has contributed to its evolution into a foundation called Congressional Sports for Charity. Created in 2016, Congressional Sports for Charity provides support to worthy and effective charities serving vulnerable children and families in the Washington DC area as well as scholarships to deserving local youth. These charities include the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Philanthropies along with the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund in gratitude to the brave officers at the Republican practice shooting on June 14, 2017.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/congressional-baseball-game">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Congressional+Baseball+Game&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+11%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ASince+1909+the+Congressional+Baseball+Game+has+been+an+annual+bipartisan+event+beloved+by+all+and+enjoyed+by+thousands.+Members+of+the+United+States+Congress+from+each+party+solidify+friendships+off+the+floor+and+on+the+field.+Over+the+last+century%2C+the+Congressional+Baseball+Game%E2%80%99s+popularity+has+contributed+to+its+evolution+into+a+foundation+called+Congressional+Sports+for+Charity.+Created+in+2016%2C+Congressional+Sports+for+Charity+provides+support+to+worthy+and+effective+charities+serving+vulnerable+children+and+families+in+the+Washington+DC+area+as+well+as+scholarships+to+deserving+local+youth.+These+charities+include+the+Boys+and+Girls+Clubs+of+Greater+Washington+and+the+Washington+Nationals+Philanthropies+along+with+the+United+States+Capitol+Police+Memorial+Fund+in+gratitude+to+the+brave+officers+at+the+Republican+practice+shooting+on+June+14%2C+2017.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fcongressional-baseball-game%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jun 19, 2025: FIU Celebrates Juneteenth</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom and achievement, while encouraging continuous self-development. As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida.</p> <p>The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <a href="https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/">https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/</a></p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/fiu_celebrates_juneteenth">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+FIU+Celebrates+Juneteenth&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+19%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AJuneteenth+celebrates+African+American+freedom+and+achievement%2C+while+encouraging+continuous+self-development.+As+recommended+in+our+Equity+Action+Initiative%2C+FIU+seeks+to+align+with+the+spirit+of+this+holiday%2C+to+make+Juneteenth+an+official+day+of+observance+at+Florida+International+University.+Additionally%2C+we+stand+in+support+of+the+Student+Government+Association+of+Florida.%0A%0AThe+theme+for+FIU+first+inaugural+Juneteenth+celebration+is+%E2%80%9CEducate%2C+Celebrate%2C+and+Heal%E2%80%9D.+Educating%2C+celebrating%2C+and+embracing+the+truths+of+Juneteenth+can+serve+to+expand+the+collective+knowledge+of+our+entire+FIU+community+and+accelerate+an+appreciation+for+the+Black+history+excluded+from+pedagogy%2C+that+may+have+framed+a+different+America.+Celebrating+Juneteenth+complements+the+work+of+the+Founding+Fathers%2C+being+the+architects+of+the+Declaration+of+Independence%2C+and+brings+to+the+conversation%2C+the+400+years+Blacks+have+tried+to+achieve+equality+in+enjoying+%E2%80%98life%2C+liberty+and+the+pursuit+of+happiness%E2%80%99.+During+this+week+of+observance%2C+we+will+provide+programming+and+activities+to+commemorate+Juneteenth+beginning+June+14+and+culminating+with+a+Juneteenth+Freedom+Day+Celebration+on+Saturday%2C+June+19+from+10am+to+4pm.+To+learn+more+about+this+celebration%2C+visit+https%3A%2F%2Face.fiu.edu%2Fjuneteenth%2F%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Ffiu_celebrates_juneteenth%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jul 7, 2025: 2025 CLACS Summer Teacher Institute: "Childhood and Youth in Latin America" at University of Wisconsin-Millwaukee</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>This three-day program will examine the experience of childhood in Latin America, as well as the institutions, practices, and conditions that have shaped the lives of children in the region. We will consider topics like school policy, youth movements, migration experiences, health and economic factors, and cultural views of children over time. The institute will feature a variety of expert presentations (speakers may include university faculty, journalists, and non-profit leaders), and allow participants time to collaboratively discuss ways to incorporate this material in their existing curriculum.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/2025-clacs-summer-teacher-institute-childhood-and-youth-in-latin-america">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+2025+CLACS+Summer+Teacher+Institute%3A+%22Childhood+and+Youth+in+Latin+America%22&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jul+7%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AThis+three-day+program+will+examine+the+experience+of+childhood+in+Latin+America%2C+as+well+as+the+institutions%2C+practices%2C+and+conditions+that+have+shaped+the+lives+of+children+in+the+region.+We+will+consider+topics+like+school+policy%2C+youth+movements%2C+migration+experiences%2C+health+and+economic+factors%2C+and+cultural+views+of+children+over+time.+The+institute+will+feature+a+variety+of+expert+presentations+%28speakers+may+include+university+faculty%2C+journalists%2C+and+non-profit+leaders%29%2C+and+allow+participants+time+to+collaboratively+discuss+ways+to+incorporate+this+material+in+their+existing+curriculum.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2F2025-clacs-summer-teacher-institute-childhood-and-youth-in-latin-america%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jul 16, 2025: Congressional Softball Game at Watkins Recreation Center</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Congressional Women’s Softball Game began in 2009 with captains Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). They brought together a team of women Members of Congress to play the female campaign staff from both parties after Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her own battle with breast cancer. In 2010, the Members asked the women of the Washington, D.C. press corps to join the game as the opponent and a lasting rivalry was born. The Congressional Women’s Softball Game has raised more than $3.7M for Young Survival Coalition (YSC) since the Game began and has become a staple of Capitol Hill summer activities.</p> <p>YSC is the premier global organization dedicated to the critical issues unique to young adults who are diagnosed with breast cancer. They offer resources, connections and outreach so young adults feel supported, empowered and hopeful. Breast cancer is something few young women ever think will happen to them – and certainly not at such an early age. When faced with a diagnosis, they may feel confused, angry and isolated. YSC is a place where young adults can go to find a circle of support and the best information available to navigate their treatment and their lives.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/congressional-softball-game">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Congressional+Softball+Game&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jul+16%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AThe+Congressional+Women%E2%80%99s+Softball+Game+began+in+2009+with+captains+Rep.+Debbie+Wasserman+Schultz+%28D-FL%29%2C+Rep.+Jo+Ann+Emerson+%28R-MO%29%2C+Sen.+Kirsten+Gillibrand+%28D-NY%29+and+Sen.+Susan+Collins+%28R-ME%29.+They+brought+together+a+team+of+women+Members+of+Congress+to+play+the+female+campaign+staff+from+both+parties+after+Debbie+Wasserman+Schultz+announced+her+own+battle+with+breast+cancer.++In+2010%2C+the+Members+asked+the+women+of+the+Washington%2C+D.C.+press+corps+to+join+the+game+as+the+opponent+and+a+lasting+rivalry+was+born.+The+Congressional+Women%E2%80%99s+Softball+Game+has+raised+more+than+%243.7M+for+Young+Survival+Coalition+%28YSC%29+since+the+Game+began+and+has+become+a+staple+of+Capitol+Hill+summer+activities.%0A%0AYSC+is+the+premier+global+organization+dedicated+to+the+critical+issues+unique+to+young+adults+who+are+diagnosed+with+breast+cancer.+They+offer+resources%2C+connections+and+outreach+so+young+adults+feel+supported%2C+empowered+and+hopeful.+Breast+cancer+is+something+few+young+women+ever+think+will+happen+to+them+%E2%80%93+and+certainly+not+at+such+an+early+age.+When+faced+with+a+diagnosis%2C+they+may+feel+confused%2C+angry+and+isolated.+YSC+is+a+place+where+young+adults+can+go+to+find+a+circle+of+support+and+the+best+information+available+to+navigate+their+treatment+and+their+lives.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fcongressional-softball-game%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>
