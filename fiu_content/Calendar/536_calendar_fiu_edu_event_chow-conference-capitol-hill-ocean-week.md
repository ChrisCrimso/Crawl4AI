Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW) is the nation’s premier ocean and Great Lakes policy conference hosted by the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation that convenes policymakers, scientists, managers, business leaders, conservationists, educators, students, and members of the public to engage in dialogue and debate on significant issues that impact our ocean and Great Lakes and to propose innovative policies and partnerships to address these issues. For more information, please visit the .
Each year, thousands of people who have a stake in the future of our waters and our planet converge at CHOW to hear from the preeminent voices—and future leaders—in our industry, glimpse the future of marine technology, and meet the policymakers eliciting change on the local, state, national and global levels. The topics discussed at CHOW become the mainstream headlines about our ocean, coasts and Great Lakes, and all are welcome to the dialogue. And we need your voice too.
