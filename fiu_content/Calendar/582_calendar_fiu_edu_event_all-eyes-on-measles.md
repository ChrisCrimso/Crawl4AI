Dr. Mary Jo Trepka is a professor and chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the FIU Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work. She is board certified in preventive medicine and public health and was trained as an epidemic intelligence service officer by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**About the Faculty Lecture Series**
The Faculty Lecture Series is an initiative designed to connect students, faculty, staff, and the broader community with timely, expert-led insights on today’s most pressing health-related topics. The lecture series was created by the Academic Health Center team to feature presentations by FIU faculty and leading healthcare experts on a range of subjects including emerging research, medical innovations, public health issues, and the evolving landscape of healthcare technology and policy. Each session offers attendees the opportunity to engage with experts, deepen their understanding of current health challenges, and explore the future of health and medicine.
