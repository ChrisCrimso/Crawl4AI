**Sinema Chat** is a curated film screening and interactive conversation exploring Haitian identity, memory, diaspora, and belonging. The program features five award-winning short films—Tifi, La Vie, Konpa, Boat People, and Prestige—that reflect on personal and national histories shaping Haitian communities across generations. Following the screening, a lecture will delve into the lived and cultural experiences that inspired each film. The event concludes with Sinema Chat, a dynamic, audience-driven dialogue where viewers engage directly with the filmmaker in an open, conversational format. This unique approach invites deeper reflection on migration, resilience, and the power of storytelling in the Haitian experience.
**GUEST SPEAKER: Al’ikens Placher** is a filmmaker from Haiti. His films have won various awards and screened at a variety of festivals, including winning an HBO BEST SHORT FILM award, having both a world premiere in competition at TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL, and an OSCAR-QUALIFIED short film.
**_In Haitian Creole. Part of LACC’s Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) Lecture Series and LACC’s Haitian Studies Program of Excellence. Made possible with support from LACC’s US Department of Education Title VI Grant._**
