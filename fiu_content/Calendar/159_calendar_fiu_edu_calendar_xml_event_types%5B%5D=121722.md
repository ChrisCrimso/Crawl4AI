For more information, please visit the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation website. 
Each year, thousands of people who have a stake in the future of our waters and our planet converge at CHOW to hear from the preeminent voices—and future leaders—in our industry, glimpse the future of marine technology, and meet the policymakers eliciting change on the local, state, national and global levels. The topics discussed at CHOW become the mainstream headlines about our ocean, coasts and Great Lakes, and all are welcome to the dialogue. And we need your voice too.

Members of the United States Congress from each party solidify friendships off the floor and on the field. Over the last century, the Congressional Baseball Game’s popularity has contributed to its evolution into a foundation called Congressional Sports for Charity. Created in 2016, Congressional Sports for Charity provides support to worthy and effective charities serving vulnerable children and families in the Washington DC area as well as scholarships to deserving local youth. These charities include the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Philanthropies along with the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund in gratitude to the brave officers at the Republican practice shooting on June 14, 2017.

As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida. 
The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/>

<title>May 20, 2025: The Bayonet and the Quill: Poland and Haiti in the Script of 1805 at MBUS - SoA Miami Beach Urban Studios</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Set in the Design Gallery alongside the Creole Archive Project: Poloné Nwa - Constitution 1805 exhibition, this thought-provoking panel discussion brings together Haitian-born American artist Edouard Duval-Carrié and FIU’s Ratcliffe Art + Design Incubator Director and Professor of Art + Art History Jacek Kolasiński. The conversation delves into the complex history and cultural legacy of the 1805 alliance between Polish legionnaires and Haitian revolutionaries.

<title>May 21, 2025: Cuba’s Eternal Night at RDB - Rafael Diaz-Balart Law Building</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>What has become of Cuba since the historic protests of July 11, 2021—and the regime’s swift and brutal crackdown? Cuba’s Eternal Night follows 5 Cubans over 2 harrowing years as they struggle with government repression, scarcity of food and medicine, and the biggest mass exodus the island has ever experienced. Yet amidst the darkness, these five individuals choose to share their lives, boldly and on camera, offering a rare and intimate look inside a nation unraveling. <br /> <br />Jordan Allott is a documentary filmmaker and founder of In Altum Productions (IAP). His work explores themes ranging from international human rights and American politics to Catholic spirituality. <br /> <br />Yoe Suárez is an award-winning journalist and writer. He was an independent journalist in Cuba during the filming and became the film´s field producer. He now lives in the U.S. <br /> <br />Father Alberto Reyes Pías is a Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Camagüey, Cuba. He is one of the most articulate and courageous voices on freedom in Cuba today. <br /> <br />This event is free and open to the public. It will be held in Spanish. To confirm your in-person attendance, please write to <a href="mailto:cri@fiu.edu">cri@fiu.edu</a> or call at (305) 348–1991</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/cubas-eternal-night">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Cuba%E2%80%99s+Eternal+Night&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+May+21%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AWhat+has+become+of+Cuba+since+the+historic+protests+of+July+11%2C+2021%E2%80%94and+the+regime%E2%80%99s+swift+and+brutal+crackdown%3F+Cuba%E2%80%99s+Eternal+Night+follows+5+Cubans+over+2+harrowing+years+as+they+struggle+with+government+repression%2C+scarcity+of+food+and+medicine%2C+and+the+biggest+mass+exodus+the+island+has+ever+experienced.+Yet+amidst+the+darkness%2C+these+five+individuals+choose+to+share+their+lives%2C+boldly+and+on+camera%2C+offering+a+rare+and+intimate+look+inside+a+nation+unraveling.%0A+%0AJordan+Allott+is+a+documentary+filmmaker+and+founder+of+In+Altum+Productions+%28IAP%29.+His+work+explores+themes+ranging+from+international+human+rights+and+American+politics+to+Catholic+spirituality.%0A+%0AYoe+Su%C3%A1rez+is+an+award-winning+journalist+and+writer.+He+was+an+independent+journalist+in+Cuba+during+the+filming+and+became+the+film%C2%B4s+field+producer.+He+now+lives+in+the+U.S.%0A+%0AFather+Alberto+Reyes+P%C3%ADas+is+a+Roman+Catholic+priest+in+the+Archdiocese+of+Camag%C3%BCey%2C+Cuba.+He+is+one+of+the+most+articulate+and+courageous+voices+on+freedom+in+Cuba+today.%0A+%0AThis+event+is+free+and+open+to+the+public.+It+will+be+held+in+Spanish.+To+confirm+your+in-person+attendance%2C+please+write+to+cri%40fiu.edu+or+call+at+%28305%29+348%E2%80%931991%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fcubas-eternal-night%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>May 29, 2025: Language, Culture and Society in Havana in 1830 at GL - Green Library</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years before the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830, who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island.</p> <p>GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.</p> <p>This event is co-sponsored by the Kimberly Green Latin America and Caribbean Center and FIU Libraries. This event is made possible with the support of LACC's Department of Education Title VI Grant.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW) is the nation’s premier ocean and Great Lakes policy conference hosted by the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation that convenes policymakers, scientists, managers, business leaders, conservationists, educators, students, and members of the public to engage in dialogue and debate on significant issues that impact our ocean and Great Lakes and to propose innovative policies and partnerships to address these issues. For more information, please visit the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation website.</p> <p>Each year, thousands of people who have a stake in the future of our waters and our planet converge at CHOW to hear from the preeminent voices—and future leaders—in our industry, glimpse the future of marine technology, and meet the policymakers eliciting change on the local, state, national and global levels. The topics discussed at CHOW become the mainstream headlines about our ocean, coasts and Great Lakes, and all are welcome to the dialogue. And we need your voice too.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/chow-conference-capitol-hill-ocean-week">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+CHOW+Conference+%28Capitol+Hill+Ocean+Week%29&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+3%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ACapitol+Hill+Ocean+Week+%28CHOW%29+is+the+nation%E2%80%99s+premier+ocean+and+Great+Lakes+policy+conference+hosted+by+the+National+Marine+Sanctuary+Foundation+that+convenes+policymakers%2C+scientists%2C+managers%2C+business+leaders%2C+conservationists%2C+educators%2C+students%2C+and+members+of+the+public+to+engage+in+dialogue+and+debate+on+significant+issues+that+impact+our+ocean+and+Great+Lakes+and+to+propose+innovative+policies+and+partnerships+to+address+these+issues.+For+more+information%2C+please+visit+the+National+Marine+Sanctuary+Foundation+website.%0A%0AEach+year%2C+thousands+of+people+who+have+a+stake+in+the+future+of+our+waters+and+our+planet+converge+at+CHOW+to+hear+from+the+preeminent+voices%E2%80%94and+future+leaders%E2%80%94in+our+industry%2C+glimpse+the+future+of+marine+technology%2C+and+meet+the+policymakers+eliciting+change+on+the+local%2C+state%2C+national+and+global+levels.+The+topics+discussed+at+CHOW+become+the+mainstream+headlines+about+our+ocean%2C+coasts+and+Great+Lakes%2C+and+all+are+welcome+to+the+dialogue.+And+we+need+your+voice+too.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fchow-conference-capitol-hill-ocean-week%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW) is the nation’s premier ocean and Great Lakes policy conference hosted by the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation that convenes policymakers, scientists, managers, business leaders, conservationists, educators, students, and members of the public to engage in dialogue and debate on significant issues that impact our ocean and Great Lakes and to propose innovative policies and partnerships to address these issues. For more information, please visit the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation website.</p> <p>Each year, thousands of people who have a stake in the future of our waters and our planet converge at CHOW to hear from the preeminent voices—and future leaders—in our industry, glimpse the future of marine technology, and meet the policymakers eliciting change on the local, state, national and global levels. The topics discussed at CHOW become the mainstream headlines about our ocean, coasts and Great Lakes, and all are welcome to the dialogue. And we need your voice too.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/chow-conference-capitol-hill-ocean-week">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+CHOW+Conference+%28Capitol+Hill+Ocean+Week%29&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+4%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ACapitol+Hill+Ocean+Week+%28CHOW%29+is+the+nation%E2%80%99s+premier+ocean+and+Great+Lakes+policy+conference+hosted+by+the+National+Marine+Sanctuary+Foundation+that+convenes+policymakers%2C+scientists%2C+managers%2C+business+leaders%2C+conservationists%2C+educators%2C+students%2C+and+members+of+the+public+to+engage+in+dialogue+and+debate+on+significant+issues+that+impact+our+ocean+and+Great+Lakes+and+to+propose+innovative+policies+and+partnerships+to+address+these+issues.+For+more+information%2C+please+visit+the+National+Marine+Sanctuary+Foundation+website.%0A%0AEach+year%2C+thousands+of+people+who+have+a+stake+in+the+future+of+our+waters+and+our+planet+converge+at+CHOW+to+hear+from+the+preeminent+voices%E2%80%94and+future+leaders%E2%80%94in+our+industry%2C+glimpse+the+future+of+marine+technology%2C+and+meet+the+policymakers+eliciting+change+on+the+local%2C+state%2C+national+and+global+levels.+The+topics+discussed+at+CHOW+become+the+mainstream+headlines+about+our+ocean%2C+coasts+and+Great+Lakes%2C+and+all+are+welcome+to+the+dialogue.+And+we+need+your+voice+too.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fchow-conference-capitol-hill-ocean-week%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jun 11, 2025: Congressional Baseball Game at Nationals Park</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Since 1909 the Congressional Baseball Game has been an annual bipartisan event beloved by all and enjoyed by thousands. Members of the United States Congress from each party solidify friendships off the floor and on the field. Over the last century, the Congressional Baseball Game’s popularity has contributed to its evolution into a foundation called Congressional Sports for Charity. Created in 2016, Congressional Sports for Charity provides support to worthy and effective charities serving vulnerable children and families in the Washington DC area as well as scholarships to deserving local youth. These charities include the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Philanthropies along with the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund in gratitude to the brave officers at the Republican practice shooting on June 14, 2017.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/congressional-baseball-game">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Congressional+Baseball+Game&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+11%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ASince+1909+the+Congressional+Baseball+Game+has+been+an+annual+bipartisan+event+beloved+by+all+and+enjoyed+by+thousands.+Members+of+the+United+States+Congress+from+each+party+solidify+friendships+off+the+floor+and+on+the+field.+Over+the+last+century%2C+the+Congressional+Baseball+Game%E2%80%99s+popularity+has+contributed+to+its+evolution+into+a+foundation+called+Congressional+Sports+for+Charity.+Created+in+2016%2C+Congressional+Sports+for+Charity+provides+support+to+worthy+and+effective+charities+serving+vulnerable+children+and+families+in+the+Washington+DC+area+as+well+as+scholarships+to+deserving+local+youth.+These+charities+include+the+Boys+and+Girls+Clubs+of+Greater+Washington+and+the+Washington+Nationals+Philanthropies+along+with+the+United+States+Capitol+Police+Memorial+Fund+in+gratitude+to+the+brave+officers+at+the+Republican+practice+shooting+on+June+14%2C+2017.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fcongressional-baseball-game%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jun 19, 2025: FIU Celebrates Juneteenth</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom and achievement, while encouraging continuous self-development. As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida.</p> <p>The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <a href="https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/">https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/</a></p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/fiu_celebrates_juneteenth">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+FIU+Celebrates+Juneteenth&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+19%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AJuneteenth+celebrates+African+American+freedom+and+achievement%2C+while+encouraging+continuous+self-development.+As+recommended+in+our+Equity+Action+Initiative%2C+FIU+seeks+to+align+with+the+spirit+of+this+holiday%2C+to+make+Juneteenth+an+official+day+of+observance+at+Florida+International+University.+Additionally%2C+we+stand+in+support+of+the+Student+Government+Association+of+Florida.%0A%0AThe+theme+for+FIU+first+inaugural+Juneteenth+celebration+is+%E2%80%9CEducate%2C+Celebrate%2C+and+Heal%E2%80%9D.+Educating%2C+celebrating%2C+and+embracing+the+truths+of+Juneteenth+can+serve+to+expand+the+collective+knowledge+of+our+entire+FIU+community+and+accelerate+an+appreciation+for+the+Black+history+excluded+from+pedagogy%2C+that+may+have+framed+a+different+America.+Celebrating+Juneteenth+complements+the+work+of+the+Founding+Fathers%2C+being+the+architects+of+the+Declaration+of+Independence%2C+and+brings+to+the+conversation%2C+the+400+years+Blacks+have+tried+to+achieve+equality+in+enjoying+%E2%80%98life%2C+liberty+and+the+pursuit+of+happiness%E2%80%99.+During+this+week+of+observance%2C+we+will+provide+programming+and+activities+to+commemorate+Juneteenth+beginning+June+14+and+culminating+with+a+Juneteenth+Freedom+Day+Celebration+on+Saturday%2C+June+19+from+10am+to+4pm.+To+learn+more+about+this+celebration%2C+visit+https%3A%2F%2Face.fiu.edu%2Fjuneteenth%2F%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Ffiu_celebrates_juneteenth%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jul 11, 2025: Sinema Chat-28th Annual Haitian Summer Institute Lecture Series at SIPA II</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Sinema Chat is a curated film screening and interactive conversation exploring Haitian identity, memory, diaspora, and belonging. The program features five award-winning short films—Tifi, La Vie, Konpa, Boat People, and Prestige—that reflect on personal and national histories shaping Haitian communities across generations. Following the screening, a lecture will delve into the lived and cultural experiences that inspired each film. The event concludes with Sinema Chat, a dynamic, audience-driven dialogue where viewers engage directly with the filmmaker in an open, conversational format. This unique approach invites deeper reflection on migration, resilience, and the power of storytelling in the Haitian experience.</p> <p>GUEST SPEAKER: Al’ikens Placher is a filmmaker from Haiti. His films have won various awards and screened at a variety of festivals, including winning an HBO BEST SHORT FILM award, having both a world premiere in competition at TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL, and an OSCAR-QUALIFIED short film.</p> <p>In Haitian Creole. Part of LACC’s Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC) Lecture Series and LACC’s Haitian Studies Program of Excellence. Made possible with support from LACC’s US Department of Education Title VI Grant.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/sinema-chat-28th-annual-haitian-summer-institute-lecture-series">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Sinema+Chat-28th+Annual+Haitian+Summer+Institute+Lecture+Series&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jul+11%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ASinema+Chat+is+a+curated+film+screening+and+interactive+conversation+exploring+Haitian+identity%2C+memory%2C+diaspora%2C+and+belonging.+The+program+features+five+award-winning+short+films%E2%80%94Tifi%2C+La+Vie%2C+Konpa%2C+Boat+People%2C+and+Prestige%E2%80%94that+reflect+on+personal+and+national+histories+shaping+Haitian+communities+across+generations.+Following+the+screening%2C+a+lecture+will+delve+into+the+lived+and+cultural+experiences+that+inspired+each+film.+The+event+concludes+with+Sinema+Chat%2C+a+dynamic%2C+audience-driven+dialogue+where+viewers+engage+directly+with+the+filmmaker+in+an+open%2C+conversational+format.+This+unique+approach+invites+deeper+reflection+on+migration%2C+resilience%2C+and+the+power+of+storytelling+in+the+Haitian+experience.%0A%0AGUEST+SPEAKER%3A+Al%E2%80%99ikens+Placher+is+a+filmmaker+from+Haiti.+His+films+have+won+various+awards+and+screened+at+a+variety+of+festivals%2C+including+winning+an+HBO+BEST+SHORT+FILM+award%2C+having+both+a+world+premiere+in+competition+at+TRIBECA+FILM+FESTIVAL%2C+and+an+OSCAR-QUALIFIED+short+film.%0A%0AIn+Haitian+Creole.+Part+of+LACC%E2%80%99s+Foreign+Languages+Across+the+Curriculum+%28FLAC%29+Lecture+Series+and+LACC%E2%80%99s+Haitian+Studies+Program+of+Excellence.+Made+possible+with+support+from+LACC%E2%80%99s+US+Department+of+Education+Title+VI+Grant.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Fsinema-chat-28th-annual-haitian-summer-institute-lecture-series%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>
