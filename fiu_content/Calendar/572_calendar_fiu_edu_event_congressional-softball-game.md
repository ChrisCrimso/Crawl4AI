**The Congressional Women’s Softball Game began in 2009 with captains Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). They brought together a team of women Members of Congress to play the female campaign staff from both parties after Debbie Wasserman Schultz****her own battle with breast cancer. In 2010, the Members asked the women of the Washington, D.C. press corps to join the game as the opponent and a lasting rivalry was born. The Congressional Women’s Softball Game has raised more than $3.7M for****(YSC) since the Game began and has become a staple of Capitol Hill summer activities. YSC is the premier global organization dedicated to the critical issues unique to young adults who are diagnosed with breast cancer. They offer resources, connections and outreach so young adults feel supported, empowered and hopeful. Breast cancer is something few young women ever think will happen to them – and certainly not at such an early age. When faced with a diagnosis, they may feel confused, angry and isolated. YSC is a place where young adults can go to find a circle of support and the best information available to navigate their treatment and their lives.**
