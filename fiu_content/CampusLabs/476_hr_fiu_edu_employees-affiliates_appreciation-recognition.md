## Student Employee of the Year (SEOTY)
Each year, FIU proudly recognizes the invaluable contributions of our student employees at the **Student Employee of the Year (SEOTY) Awards.** As an integral part of our Panther family, student employees exemplify Service Excellence, leadership, and commitment to FIU’s mission.
This university-wide celebration honors the dedication, talent, and impact of our student employees who go above and beyond in their roles, driving innovation and success across the university.
Nominations open each Fall semester! Stay connected through HR News & Updates for details on how to recognize an outstanding student employee. Let’s celebrate the excellence that makes FIU unstoppable!
### Frequently Asked Questions
#### How do I nominate a student employee?
A university wide communication will be sent out about three months prior to the event that contains a link that will allow supervisors to nominate student employees in their department.
#### Who can I nominate?
The students must meet the following criteria:
  * Degree-seeking part-time/full-time student enrolled and employed in a student-level position on/off campus.
  * Undergraduate/Graduate students employed as Student Assistants or Federal Work Study.
  * Employed by the department for a minimum of 3 months.


#### Who is not eligible for nominations?
  * Graduate, Teaching or Research Assistants with a UGS contract are not eligible.
  * Temporary or benefit earning employees.


#### When will winners be announced?
Winners will be announced and celebrated during National Student Employment week, the second week of April. 
### National Student Employment Week
Each year, FIU joins colleges and universities nation-wide to celebrate “National Student Employment Week”. The university takes great pride in preparing our nation‘s workforce by providing quality education and the opportunity for students to apply classroom learning on the job. Nearly two-thirds of today‘s college students hold part- or full-time jobs while in school and it is for this reason that FIU recognizes and awards these students. The National Student Employment Association (NSEA) has declared that the second week in April will serve to celebrate those students who work with enthusiasm, dedication, and initiative to support their campus with a spectacular workforce.
**The purpose of this week is threefold:**
  1. To enhance awareness of student employment and its important role in higher education experience.
  2. To recognize students who perform outstanding work while attending college.
  3. To thank YOU, the supervisors, who hire students for part-time positions and make the student employment program such a success.

## FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day
Each year faculty and staff are invited to participate in FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day with their children, ages 8 to 18. Through a full day of enriching activities, this event exposes our future Panthers to a broad range of educational opportunities at FIU, as well as an opportunity to provide children with insights on how your important role contributes to the overall success of our outstanding university. This event takes place every spring. Stay tuned to our HR News & Updates biweekly newsletter for more info!
FIU’s Bring Your Child to Work Day has proven to be an impactful event, sparking curiosity and igniting passions in many young participants, guiding them towards discovering their interests and potential career paths.
![Vanessa Berrios \(left\) at the 2014 FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day, where she was inspired to pursue nursing. Nine years later, she earned her pin from the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences \(right\).](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-300x176.jpg)_Vanessa Berrios (left) at the 2014 FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day, where she was inspired to pursue nursing. Nine years later, she earned her pin from the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences (right)._
During FIU’s 2023 Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences Pinning Ceremony, nursing program graduate Vanessa Berrios reminisced about her time at FIU. Among her cherished memories, she highlighted the 2014 FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day event, which ignited her academic journey and led to her exciting career as a registered nurse at Baptist Health South Florida.
Vanessa’s mother, Mabel Berrios, Senior Library Specialist, Library Operations at FIU’s Modesto A. Maidique campus shares with us that in addition to the FIU health insurance plan, “Another amazing benefit we have at the university is our tuition waiver, which provides the opportunity for employees or their dependents to study with the university. Both of my daughters have taken advantage of this opportunity. I am so thankful for this to be one of our benefits because it plays a big role in financial stress relief.
The recognition and appreciation programs that FIU offers keeps its employees engaged. FIU Bring Your Child to Work Day is the most memorable event for me and my family and gives us the opportunity to show all the different programs FIU has to offer. It brings us together, motivating and inspiring the next generation of professionals to come receive their education from our FIU.”
Thanks to FIU’s [tuition waiver for faculty, staff, and their dependents](https://hr.fiu.edu/employees-affiliates/benefits/), Vanessa was able to pursue her education with the support of this valuable benefit. Congratulations to Vanessa, and a heartfelt thank you to her mother, Mabel, for introducing her to the endless possibilities of Panther nation.
