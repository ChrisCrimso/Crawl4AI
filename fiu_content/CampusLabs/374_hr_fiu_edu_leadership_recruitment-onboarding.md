# Recruitment & Onboarding
## Independent Contractor or Employee?
The following [guide](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Supplier-or-Employee.pdf) was developed to help departments evaluate whether an individual who will perform services for the university should be paid as an employee through the Division of Human Resources, or an Independent Contractor (Supplier) through the Office of the Controller. If there is any doubt, the individual should be hired as an employee.
In certain situations, however, the individual cannot be paid as either an employee or a contractor without additional considerations:
  * The employee retired from the Florida Retirement System or State University System Optional Retirement Program (SUSORP) within the past year. 
    * If a retiree is considering providing services as an independent contractor or returning to employment during the first 12 calendar months after retirement, they will need approval from The Division of Retirement before they can do so. Please contact Benefits Administration for assistance.
  * The employee will be under the direct or indirect supervision of a related person. 
    * If a candidate has disclosed on the employment application that they have a relationship with someone at the university, a Nepotism Disclosure Form must be completed for review by the Division of Human Resources prior to the hire.
  * The individual is not eligible for rehire. 
    * If the individual is a former employee of the university who was deemed “ineligible for rehire”, they would not be able to work as either an employee or independent contractor.

**9192 – Federal Work Study (FWS):** To provide a more comprehensive and equitable basis for compensating Federal Work Study, Talent Acquisition and Management within the Division of Human Resources designed this salary guideline for FWS employment based on the Federal Student Aid requirements. The rate of pay for each position level will be determined by the specific responsibilities and qualifications stipulated in the FWS Posting Request Form.
### Frequently Asked Questions
**What is the criteria for me to hire a candidate as a student employee?** The student candidate must be enrolled at FIU at least part-time six (6) credits undergraduate or three (3) credits graduate.
**Why are all students only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours a week?** 20 hour limit for student employees is a directive from the Office of the Provost. The rationale is that the student’s primary focus should be on their academic role. This also allows them to be exempt from Social Security and Medicare tax while being a student employee.
**Can my student ever work more than 20 hours a week?** Yes. During the semester breaks (winter break, spring break, and summer break) students can work a maximum of 30 hours a week.
**Is there a training for FWS and student employees recruiting and hiring?** Yes. A separate in person or webinar for FWS Employment and Student Employment is provided annually in the first week of August. Email communications are sent out to HR Liaisons and hiring managers on our email listserv at least three weeks in advance.
**Who determines rate of pay for the FWS posting?** FWS posting rate of pay are assigned by Student & Alumni Employment-HR based on specific responsibilities and qualifications stipulated in the job description.
**What should I do if my FWS activity number does not populate on the[FWS Hire Form](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2016_FWS_Employment_Webinar.pdf)? ** If the activity number is not populated, it may need to be activated by Financial Aid. The department must email Adelfa Ukenye, Assistant Director Financial Aid, and request the number be activated.
**How do I know if I am using the correct[FWS Hire form](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2016_FWS_Employment_Webinar.pdf)? ** Before submitting the [FWS Hire form](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2016_FWS_Employment_Webinar.pdf), the preparer must ensure that the current academic year is populating on the top right hand corner of the form.
**Can a FWS employee also hold a position as a regular Student employee?** Yes, as long as it is not for the same job as the FWS position in the same department, and as long as the total hours between the jobs do not exceed 20 hours a week.
**Does the FWS record have to be the same pay rate as the student employee record?** If the student is performing the same job functions on the student employee record during breaks from the FWS record, the rate of pay MUST be the same for both.
**How do I hire FWS employees during the spring semester?** A Spring Hiring Toolkit with steps required to onboard your Spring candidate has been created and posted above to assist departments when hiring FWS employees.

### Frequently Asked Questions
**What does “exempt” mean?** Employees in exempt positions do not receive overtime pay no matter how many hours they work in a workweek. Since they do not receive overtime pay, there is no need for them to keep records of the specific hours they work. 
**What does “non-exempt” mean?** Employees who work in non-exempt positions are not exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. They keep records of the specific times they work so that they are paid overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the employee’s hourly rate.
**How do I know if an assignment is exempt or non-exempt?** Very specific criteria must be met for a position to be designated as exempt. If the criteria, or tests, cannot be met then the position is non-exempt. Here are some of the main criteria or tests:
  * If the position is teaching or conducting research in chosen field of study, the position is exempt. This applies to adjuncts and teaching/research assistants.
  * If the position has a total salary of not less than $684 per week the position may be exempt; however, additional criteria must be met.
  * If the salary requirement is met, there are a variety of other criteria that may dictate whether a position is exempt or non-exempt.


Please contact our Compensation Administration department at cmpadmin@fiu.edu for detailed information.
**Do non-exempt employees complete a timesheet?** Yes. All non-exempt employees will receive access to a timesheet in the PantherSoft HR system to report hours worked daily. After their sign-on packet has been processed, the HR Liaison and Supervisor will receive the onboarding email with the new employee log in information, subject: “FIU MyAccounts HR On-Boarding Automated Notification Program” from the Division of Information Technology.
As a non-exempt employee, the employee would enter their start time and end time for each day worked. If an employee on a temporary appointment works through their lunch period, the manager must adjust their time.
Supervisors must approve employee time by 2:00 p.m. the Monday after the payroll closing week via PantherSoft HR. The payroll deadlines can be accessed via the [HR calendar](https://hr.fiu.edu/payroll-calendars-schedules/).
Since exempt employees are paid on a bi-weekly basis, they are not required to interact with a timesheet in the PantherSoft HR system.
**Can I hire a Temporary employee who is under the age of 18 (minor)?** Yes. A department can hire someone who is between the age of 14 and 17, however all employees intending to work directly with the minor are required to complete and clear a Level II background (criminal background check + fingerprinting) prior to the minor being able to start working.
**Does a minor complete the same sign-on packet as one who is of legal age?** Yes. A student employee who is a minor will complete the same new employee sign-on packet, however, there are certain forms in the packet that will need to be signed by their parent or legal Guardian. The parent or legal guardian should come in person with the student to complete and submit this paperwork to HR.
## Search & Screen Process
Search and Screen is the process by which Florida International University promotes the recruitment of diverse faculty and staff in accordance with the university’s Affirmative Action Plan. This process is used primarily in the hiring of full-time faculty and senior level positions. Search committees and hiring managers must familiarize themselves with relevant policies and procedures to ensure equal and open access employment opportunities to all potential applicants.

## New Employee Orientation and Onboarding
Managers play a key role in helping a new employee feel welcomed and become acquainted with FIU’s processes and culture. The first six months are critical to an employee’s success at the university. There are three broad categories of information a new employee needs:
  1. Information about the university
  2. College/division/department-specific information
  3. Job-specific information


### University Information – New Employee Orientation
University information is covered at New Employee Experience (NEE). It is hosted every first Monday of each pay period and takes place online via Zoom. New employees should attend NEE on their first day of work. Topics covered include FIU’s vision, mission and values, high-level overview of policies and procedures, employee services, sexual harassment, and Florida’s Code of Ethics.
[NEE Agenda](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Virtual-New-Employee-Experience-Agenda.pdf)
### College/Division/Department Information
Specific information about the college/business unit is the department’s responsibility and managers should consult their unit’s HR Liaison for further information.
### Job-specific Information
Job-specific information is the manager’s responsibility. Providing clear direction and expectations is pivotal to a new hire’s confidence and success. A new employee’s training plan can take many forms, but may include the following activities:
  * Shadowing a colleague in your department
  * Meeting colleagues in other departments you partner or work with frequently
  * Manuals and other documented instructions and procedures
  * Coaching sessions conducted by you or others
  * Formal training
