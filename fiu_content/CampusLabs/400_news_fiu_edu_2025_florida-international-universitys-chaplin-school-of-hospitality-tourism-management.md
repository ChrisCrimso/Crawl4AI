The Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management at Florida International University (FIU) is soaring to the top and being recognized as a leader in hospitality and tourism management education. According to the 2025 QS World University Rankings by Subject: Hospitality & Leisure Management, the Chaplin School climbed from No. 6 to No. 4 among U.S. public research universities.
“We are committed to educating the future leaders of hospitality through experiential learning and curricula that is current, relevant and unique,” said Michael Cheng, Chaplin School dean and professor. “The continued rise of our program is a testament to our vision to set the global standard for experiential education and expertise in hospitality,” he added.
The school has stayed steady on its trajectory to the top under Cheng’s leadership and a new vision and mission to bring hospitality education to life through exciting and engaging experiences and industry partnerships. This year, the school ranked 4th in the U.S. and remained 31st globally.
The QS or Quacquarelli Symonds World Rankings by Subject uses five key metrics to compile the subject rankings: academic and employer reputation based on the responses of more than 240,000 employers and academics to QS surveys, citations per paper, H-Index and international research collaboration.
FIU Chaplin School’s rankings are a result of concentrating efforts on key performance indicators, such as student success, First Time in College (FTIC), four-year graduation rate, and two-year retention rates.
Other contributing factors to the Chaplin School’s continued success includes its dedicated faculty and staff, along with key partnerships with top industry leaders. In addition, the school is also known for student engagement and unique experiential learning opportunities, such as leadership roles only open to FIU students at the South Beach Wine & Food Festival (SOBEWFF®), one of the largest and most well-renowned wine festivals and events in the world.
The school offers 9 undergraduate majors, 7 graduate specializations and a new Doctorate in Business Administration (DBA) with a concentration in hospitality. This upcoming fall, two fully in-person undergraduate programs are being introduced, a Bachelor of Arts in Global Sustainable Tourism and a Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management with a Cruise Line Management track. Students can also choose the school’s one-of-a-kind Master of Science degree concentrating on Cruise Lines Operations Management in the Cruise Capital of the World.
“We are proud of our QS rankings and especially pleased that QS recognized FIU’s depth and breadth, as we have top 50 programs ranked in each of the five broad faculty areas,” said Provost, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Elizabeth M. Béjar.
FIU Hospitality is one of 13 Florida International University (FIU) programs that ranked in the top 50 among U.S. public universities in 2025.
