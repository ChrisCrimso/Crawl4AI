Hi all AED members, We have just added a new volunteering opportunity by partnering with The Miami VA Fisher House. We need your help with volunteering, fundraising, and organizing an event to celebrate Veterans Day.
The dates to volunteer are October 23, November 13 and December 4.
The Miami VA Fisher House enables family members to be close to their loved ones during hospitalization, by providing comfortable lodging, in a beautiful and relaxing setting, only steps away from the medical center. To know more about what VA Fisher House does, check the link [ https://www.miami.va.gov/giving/fisherhouse.asp](https://www.miami.va.gov/giving/fisherhouse.asp). If you would like to donate items outlined on the website [https://www.miami.va.gov/giving/wishlist.asp](https://www.miami.va.gov/giving/wishlist.asp) let me know and I will deliver them for you.
We will issue points for volunteering and donating items. Remember you need 14 points for active membership.
We need Items for meal preparation on those dates previously mentioned. If you donate $5, you will receive 2 points towards active membership, if you donate $10 you will receive 4 points. This can be in the form of gift cards, cash or through cashapp/ venmo. No more than 4 points can be issued for donating items. If you plan to volunteer you will receive 2 points for attending, 3 points for carpooling and 1 point for wearing your AED shirt.
For any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to email me through  asuro003@fiu.edu!
Cheers,
Ania Suros | Philanthropy Coordinator
