![cise logo](https://security.fiu.edu/content/logos/rss/cise.svg) Multiple Vulnerabilities in Fortinet Products Could Allow for Arbitrary Code Execution Apr 12, 2023
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Fortinet makes several products that are able to deliver high-performance network security solutions that protect your network, users, and data from continually evolving threats. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
