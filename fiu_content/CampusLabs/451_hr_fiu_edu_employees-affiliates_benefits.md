## State Retirement Options
### State Retirement Plans
As a new State employee, in a benefits-earning position, you must choose one of three retirement plans available to employees eligible for the State University System Optional Retirement Program (SUSORP). All three plans are funded by you and your employer and offer important benefits. See a [comparison](https://www.myfrs.com/pdf/forms/SUSORP-Newsltr%206-22FP.pdf) of all three plans.
Based on your position type, you may be eligible for the following plans:
  * **[FRS Pension](https://www.mybenefits.myflorida.com/financial_future/your_retirement_plan_options)** – A traditional defined benefit retirement plan designed to pay you a set amount for your lifetime, after you have met minimum vesting and retirement requirements.
  * **[FRS Investment](https://www.mybenefits.myflorida.com/financial_future/your_retirement_plan_options)** – A defined contribution retirement plan where the benefit depends on the amount of money contributed to an employee’s account and its growth over time. Employees decide how to allocate the money in your account among the available investment funds.
  * **[State University System Optional Retirement Program (SUSORP)](https://www.dms.myflorida.com/workforce_operations/retirement/optional_retirement_programs/state_university_system_optional_retirement_program)** – A defined contribution retirement plan where the benefit depends on the amount of money contributed to an employee’s account and its growth over time. Employees decide how to allocate the money in your account among the available investment funds.

#### Plan Funding and Contribution Limits
**Employee Contributions**. Based on Florida law, employees contribute 3% of their pretax salary, beginning with their first paycheck, regardless of which retirement plan they choose.**Employer Contributions**. Employer contributions are equal to a percentage of the member’s gross monthly salary. The percentage is based on the member’s membership class and is determined by the Florida Legislature and respective plan provisions.**Contribution Limits**. As required by Section 121.71(2), Florida Statutes, employee contributions are treated for tax purposes as employer-paid employee contributions (commonly called an employer pick-up) under Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2). Employee contributions are limited by [Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits)**Salaries Exceeding Federal Limits**. Federal law, under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, limits the amount of annual salary that may be applied towards retirement under a qualified retirement plan. IRC Section 415 requires the limits to be adjusted annually for [cost-of-living increases](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/cola-increases-for-dollar-limitations-on-benefits-and-contributions).For further reference, review the [MyFRS Plan Funding section](https://www.myfrs.com/Plan_Funding.htm) (FRS Plans) and the [State University System Optional Retirement Program Plan Document](https://frs.fl.gov/forms/SUSORP_Plan.pdf) (SUSORP Plan).

FIU offers a series of Voluntary Savings Plans providing you with the opportunity to plan for a secure financial future by maximizing your retirement savings. Review the different plan options and consult with your financial advisor(s) before taking any action.
#### Plan options and investment companies available at FIU:
  * **403(b) and 457(b) Pretax Plans** –Contributions are taken out of your pay before it is taxed, which lowers your taxable income. You will pay taxes on distributions.
  * **403(b) and 457(b) Roth After tax Plans** – Contributions are taken out of your paycheck after your income is taxed. This option provides tax-free growth and tax-free distributions when eligible.

Examples of such events may include: leave of absence, marital status change, address change, death in the family, preparing for retirement, among others. Please visit the [Life Events page](https://hr.fiu.edu/employees-affiliates/life-events/) for more information.

In addition, employees should refer to their respective [Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)](https://hr.fiu.edu/employees-affiliates/working-at-fiu/#collective-bargaining-agreements "https://hr.fiu.edu/employees-affiliates/working-at-fiu/#collective-bargaining-agreements") for sick leave accrual and time use policies. 
![](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/leave-accrual-table-3-21-2025-290x300.jpg)
## Sick / Catastrophic Leave Pool
**Sick Leave Pool**
Participation in the Sick Leave Pool (SLP) shall be voluntary on the part of eligible employees. Eligibility in the SLP is extended to employees after completion of six months of employment with the university, provided that a minimum of forty hours of sick and/or vacation leave has been accrued by full-time employees, or twenty hours by part-time employees. Full-time employees contribute eight hours of leave and part-time employees contribute four hours of leave to the SLP on a yearly basis. Participating employees may terminate their membership in the SLP at any time by notifying the SLP Administrator.
Sick Leave Pool hours shall be granted only for the employee’s personal illness, injury, accident, or exposure to a contagious disease. Personal illness shall include, but not limited to disabilities which are the result of or contributed to by medical conditions (including those complications related to pregnancy or childbirth), surgery and recovery.
Participating employees must have depleted all their accrued leave hours before SLP hours will be granted. A participating full-time (1.0 FTE) employee may withdraw a maximum of 480 hours from the SLP during any twelve month period. Part-time employees may withdraw a maximum of 240 hours from the SLP during any twelve month period.
Employees retrieving SLP hours are required to follow the Medical Leave of absence process. Upon receipt of required medical documentation, the SLP Administrator who is responsible for the oversight of the program, will present the request to the SLP Committee which consists of six representative employees; two administrative employees, two faculty members and two staff members. A vote of a minimum of four is needed to grant hours to the employee.
**Sick Leave Pool Membership Process** An employee has two opportunities in a year in which to join the SPL program. The first is during the Annual Open Enrollment or at the time the employee reaches their initial six months of service.
  1. During the Annual Open Enrollment or at the six month anniversary mark, eligible employees will receive via email (or if no email available, a hard copy) notice regarding the program and membership application.
  2. If the employee is interested in joining, the employee should complete the SPL Membership Application and submit it to the SPL Administrator in HR Benefits.
  3. Upon receipt, the SLP Administration will verify the employee’s eligibility to join the pool.
  4. If the employee is ineligible, the form is returned to the employee with a note on the application.
  5. If approved, a letter is generated and the approval letter along with a copy of the policy forwarded to the employee (interoffice mail) for his/her files. Deduction of membership hours against the employee’s accrued time is executed within two payroll periods.
  6. This membership is valid for one year. In order to renew and keep the membership active, a notification will be sent of the upcoming annual deduction of half the hours that were required to join the SLP.
  7. The employee may terminate the membership by sending an email to the Sick Leave Pool Administrator at hrleaves@fiu.edu.


**Catastrophic Pool**
The Catastrophic Pool is a voluntary program designed to allow eligible employees to donate sick leave hours directly from one employee to another employee who has exhausted their leave balances including sick, vacation, and compensatory time. Employees receiving Catastrophic Pool hours (donations) are required to follow the Medical Leave of absence process. Unlike the Sick Leave Pool Program, this program allows the donation of hours not only for the employee but for the employee’s immediate family member. For the purpose of this policy, immediate family is defined as spouse, child(ren) (including foster and stepchildren), parents (including stepparents) and grandparents.
**Catastrophic Pool Guidelines** The dean or director of the department where the affected employee works will need to coordinate the request, donation of hours, and secure approval from their respective vice president/provost by completing the [Catastrophic Approval Memo](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Catastrophic-Approval-Memo-_blank-003.pdf "undefined"). The coordinator must prepare a spreadsheet with the names and amount of hours donated by each employee. All donations of hours will need to be coordinated through the dean or director’s office. Once vice president/provost approval is secured, the employee that is donating the hours will need to complete the [Donation Hours Memo](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Donation-Hours-Memo-_blank.pdf "undefined") authorizing the transfer of sick leave hours.
The dean or director will need to submit to Human Resources, PC 224, the following documents:
  * Copy of the Catastrophic Approval Memo approved by the vice president/provost.
  * Individual copies of the Donation Hours Memos signed by the donating employees.
  * The spreadsheet with the panther ID, names, amount of hours donated by each employee and total amount of all donated hours.

The selected DEP payment option will remain active until a new authorization form is submitted through [PantherSoft HR Employee Self Service](https://my.fiu.edu/) and a different payment cycle is selected. All 9-month faculty members will have the opportunity to select this payment option during the 9 over 12 Deferred Earnings Program (DEP) Enrollment period that begins April through August. New faculty members will exercise their options when completing the sign-on documents.

  5. Click the “Submit” button once all your changes are complete.


To review the estimated calculation for your Deferred and Gross Earnings, please use the 9 over 12 Deferred Earnings Program (DEP) calculator.
