## Admin & Staff Compensation
### Compensation Philosophy
FIU’s compensation program is tailor-made to support, reinforce, and align with the Experience Impact 2030 strategic plan. The compensation program is grounded in the following guiding principles:
**Mission Driven:** Help Departments retain & attract the people FIU needs to be recognized as a Top 30 public university.
**Value Driven:** Accessibility to compensation policies, practices, and knowledge.
Integrity in the management of a competitive compensation program.
Respect for the dignity of each person and their contributions to FIU.
Excellence in knowledge, service, and understanding of our endeavors.
**Compliant:** FIU compensates employees in compliance with federal, state, local laws and regulations, and applicable FIU Board of Trustees’ regulations and policies as well as Board of Governor’s regulations.
**Sustainable:** FIU designs and administers compensation in a manner that is financially responsible and sustainable to ensure FIU’s goal of good stewardship over entrusted funds.
**Competitive:** As a preeminent public research university, FIU’s compensation policies and procedures are continuously reviewed for competitiveness with internal benchmarks and appropriate external markets including institutions of similar size, scope, and complexity within higher education.
### Job Family Career Ladders
Job families are grouped jobs which involve work of the same very broad nature or purpose, externally may also be known as functions (e.g. Information Technology, Human Resources, etc.). Sub families are groups of jobs within a job family that perform similar work, requiring varying levels of skill and responsibility, externally may also be known as specialty (e.g. Payroll or Benefits are sub families of Human Resources). Career levels denote different skill levels established for job codes with similar level of qualifications (e.g. Professional 1, Professional 2, etc.). Career ladders are the progressive levels of job codes that link career levels to job families and related sub families (e.g. Academic Advisor I, Academic Advisor II, etc.).

## Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure
### Overview and Definition
![Image of Nepotism - decorative](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/workplace-romance-300x200.png)FIU is a vibrant, student-centered public research university with a diverse faculty and staff. We strive to hire top notch employees to serve and support our students, which means on occasion, a family member or any other related individual may be considered for a position at the university.
Relationship to another employee of the university shall not constitute a bar to hiring or internal movement (promotions, demotions, laterals, reclassifications) as long as an employee will not be under the direct or indirect supervision of a related individual.
A new hire must disclose any relationship(s) during the application and interview process. The already existing employee should also disclose the relationship to their supervisor upon learning that their family member or any other individual is going to be hired by the university regardless as to whether or not the hire is in the same department or elsewhere.
The intent of reviewing hiring decisions is to ensure that no preferential treatment will be afforded to individuals based on relationships that may place undue or inappropriate influence on terms and conditions of employment as a result of the hire. It is important to note that FIU has an expanded definition of a relationship as outlined in the [Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure Policy](https://policies.fiu.edu/files/61.pdf) which is as follows:
_“Relationship” is defined as individuals related by blood, marriage, adoption [e.g., father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, or half-sister, Florida Statute Section 112.3135(1)(d)]; a person a public employee intends to marry, or with whom the public employee intends to form a household, or any other natural person having the same legal residence as the public employee, Florida Statute Section 112.312, Code of Ethics; domestic partnership, dating, or other personal relationship in which objectivity might be impaired._
Individuals should not be employed in a department or unit which will result in a subordinate-supervisor relationship between such individuals and any related individual as defined above through any “line of authority.” _“Line of authority”_ is defined as authority extending vertically through one or more organizational levels of supervision or management.
The university retains the right to refuse to appoint a person to a position in the same department, division, or facility, whereby their relationship to another employee can create an adverse impact on supervision, safety, security, morale, or involves a potential conflict of interest.
“Intimate Relationship” is defined as any relationship that may reasonably be described as including, but not limited to, sexual, romantic, amorous, and/or dating or the pursuit thereof. Physical contact is not a required element of such relationships. An Intimate Relationship may exist on the basis of a single interaction.The Intimate Relationship regulation works in conjunction with the University’s Nepotism Policy 1710.205 and Nepotism in Research Policy and Procedure 2320.060, to further Florida International University’s commitment to maintaining an educational and workplace environment that is inclusive and free from abuse of authority, conflict of interest, coercion, sexual harassment, and favoritism.For more information, please refer to the Nepotism Policy via the university’s Policies and Procedures Library – [policies.fiu.edu](http://policies.fiu.edu).For more information on the Intimate Relationship Regulation, please refer to the [Intimate Relationship Policy](https://regulations.fiu.edu/docs=276). 
**Procedures and Guidelines**
Related individuals, as defined by this policy, may not be supervised or work in the same division, department, or unit without prior approval from the Vice President of the Division of Human Resources or designee.
**Recruitment of New Hire**
If a candidate has disclosed on the employment application that he/she has a relationship based on the definition outlined above, the department is required to complete and submit a Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure Form to Talent Acquisition and Management in PC-234 or by email to the Recruiter for review and approval prior to the hire. The Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure form can be found in **PantherSoft HR > Employee Resources > Employee Forms > Employee Labor Relations Forms > Admin/Staff Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Form**. If the Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure is approved and the candidate is hired, it is the employee’s responsibility to submit an electronic Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure form.
**Current Employees**
We are pleased to announce the launch of the electronic Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure process to replace the manual self-disclosure process previously established. This user-friendly feature allows for a paperless and seamless electronic approval process. Due to this system enhancement, an electronic Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure is required for all employees who previously disclosed a relationship. Please log into [myhr.fiu.edu](https://myhr.fiu.edu) to submit a new electronic form if you have a relationship to disclose.
**Resources and Training**
The Division of Human Resources is offering a variety of resources to assist you through the new electronic Nepotism/Intimate Relationship Disclosure process.

## ADA Accommodation
FIU is committed to ensuring equal access to educational and employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as well as other applicable state and local laws and university policy. Under the ADA, qualified individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination and may be entitled to reasonable accommodations and/or equal access to programs and services.
FIU has a long standing policy of employing qualified persons with disabilities in a broad range of positions across the institution. On occasion, the nature of an individual’s disability may require them to receive a work-site accommodation. Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility serves as a resource for employees who have documented a qualified disability and need reasonable accommodations to perform essential job functions.
Employees should direct their requests for accommodations to CRCA. Employees who wish to request accommodations for a disability must submit the following forms along with supporting documentation to CRCA:
  1. [Employee Accommodation Request Form](https://ace.fiu.edu/_assets/docs/ada-accommodation-request-form.pdf) (to be completed by the Employee)

  4. [Physician Letter](https://ace.fiu.edu/_assets/docs/ada-physician-letter.pdf) (to be completed by the Employee)


Reasonable accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis and are based on the documentation provided. The university’s ADA Coordinator will meet individually with the employee who is seeking accommodations to discuss needs and options. Once all required documentation has been submitted, verified, and reviewed, CRCA will coordinate efforts with the appropriate parties to ensure the approved accommodation is provided to the employee.
If you are seeking accommodations for a university program offered to the public both on and/or off campus, please complete [Public Event Accommodation Request form](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Public_Event_Accommodation_Request.pdf) .

## Smoke & Tobacco Free Campus
![Tobacco & Smoke Free Campus logo - Decorative ](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Breathe-Easy-1-298x300.jpg)FIU and its leaders value the personal health and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and community. As such, in January 2011, FIU proudly became a smoke and tobacco-free campus. Under this initiative, smoking and the use of tobacco products (including electronic cigarettes) have been prohibited in all areas of FIU’s campuses. This initiative was welcomed with an overwhelming positive response from our faculty, staff, and students. Below are some frequently asked questions along with a link to [Regulation 113-2010-11-17](http://regulations.fiu.edu/docs=119 "FIU-113 Smoke and Tobacco-Free Campus") for further information.
**Why did FIU go smoke-free and tobacco-free?** It was about creating healthier campus environments for our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. It is intended to foster greater respect for one another and improve the health of the FIU family. Additionally, adopting smoke-free and tobacco-free aligns with FIU’s growing commitment to environmental sustainability.
**What areas of campus does the smoke-free and tobacco-free regulation cover?** Smoking and the use of tobacco products is prohibited on all university-owned properties, including the Modesto A. Maidique Campus, Biscayne Bay Campus, Engineering Campus, recreational facilities, residential facilities, parking lots, and garages.
**Can I smoke in my car?** Tobacco use in vehicles that are on FIU-owned properties is prohibited.
**Does FIU offer resources for students, faculty, and staff who want to quit using tobacco?** Yes. FIU is committed to helping students, faculty, and staff manage or overcome their tobacco use. Nicotine replacement therapies are available on our campuses. The following resources are available to students, faculty, and staff:
  * Individual free counseling sessions are available through [FIU Student Health](http://studentaffairs.fiu.edu/health-and-fitness/student-health/ "FIU Student Health"). For more information or to schedule an appointment, please call BBC at (305) 919-5620 ext. 4, or MMC at (305) 348-2401 ext. 5. Low-cost nicotine replacement therapy and pharmacotherapy also are available for order and purchase at the MMC Student Health Pharmacy.
  * The [Florida Department of Health](http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/prevention/tobacco-free-florida/index.html "Florida Department of Health") offers a toll-free quit line, 1-888-U-CAN-NOW (1-877-822-6669), with free resources in English and Spanish. Counselors are available 24 hours a day.
  * The [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/ "cancer.gov") offers a toll-free phone line, 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848), with access to English and Spanish speaking counselors.
  * The [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking.html "American Cancer Society") offers a toll-free phone line, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669).
  * The Miami Dade Area Health Education Center (AHEC) offers free tobacco-cessation classes. Call (305) 597-3640 for more information.
  * Visit [Smokefree.gov](https://smokefree.gov/ "smokefree.gov") for additional resources.
  * For individuals who want to quit “cold turkey” without medical treatment of their nicotine addiction, go to [www.whyquit.com](http://whyquit.com/ "whyquit.com").


**Why doesn’t FIU provide designated smoking areas on campus?** Providing a place to smoke does not support the university’s goal of creating a healthier environment. In an effort to support all members of the university community, Student Health Services has expanded its tobacco cessation programs as well as its nicotine withdrawal support (NWS) programs for tobacco users who are not ready to quit and wish to use nicotine replacement therapies while at work.
**Does the tobacco-free and smoke-free regulation extend to vendors, contracted workers, etc.?** Yes. All visitors, including vendors, contract workers, etc., will be required to refrain from using tobacco products on our campuses.
**What happens if I violate the regulation and use tobacco on campus?** First time offenders will receive a warning. The Notice of Violation will provide you with information on resources available to help you manage your tobacco use and/or resources if you are to quit.
**What happens if I violate the regulation after I have been issued a warning?** Students, faculty, and staff who violate the regulation a second time will be required to attend two smoking/tobacco management/dependence consultations with Student Health. These classes are intended to help you manage your tobacco use. You may sign up for these classes with Student Health by calling their office at BBC at (305) 919-5620 ext. 4, or MMC at (305) 348-2401, ext. 5. You must register for these classes within 14 days of receiving this notice and complete all classes within 45 calendar days of the notice. Failure to comply will result in this automatically becoming a third violation.
**What happens if I violate the regulation a third time?** Faculty and staff will be referred to the appropriate area to begin the progressive disciplinary process. Students will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution for appropriate discipline.
**What should I do if I see someone smoking and/or using tobacco products?** You can provide them with education. As you approach the user, you can inform them that we are proud to be a Smoke-Free/Tobacco-Free Campus and to please put out the tobacco product. If they refuse to cease smoking and/or the tobacco use, just walk away; do not get into a confrontational situation. The enforcement will be conducted by members of the University Police Department.

Celebrating our student employees is the culmination of a week of recognition for student employees who have demonstrated service excellence in their respective departments, while maintaining a strong academic record and gaining job experience that is valued by future employers looking to build a pipeline of talent in their organizations.
This project will help to fund the Student Employee Scholarship for the winner of the Student Employee of the Year (SEOTY) Awards.

### University Hardship Fund
The TLC University Hardship Fund is sponsored by the Tender Loving Care (TLC) Brigade and coordinated through the Office of Employee Assistance (OEA). We recognize that faculty and staff may experience hardships that require emergency financial assistance.
The Hardship Fund is not a loan, rather it is a program available to assist eligible faculty and staff (Full-time benefits-earning, faculty [9 month or 12 month] or staff, who have worked at FIU for at least one year) who are experiencing a “qualified” emergency and who have exhausted all avenues for obtaining assistance.
