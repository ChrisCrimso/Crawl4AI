Dr. Noël C. Barengo, an associate professor in the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, has been selected as the Conference USA Professor of the Year.
The award, which was established in 2024, highlights an outstanding professor from among the 10 member institutions of CUSA, an intercollegiate athletic conference that participates in NCAA Divison I sports. The award recognizes a faculty member’s dedication to teaching, research and service.
Barengo is the second person ever to receive the award and the first person to bring the title to FIU.
“Dr. Noël C. Barengo exemplifies a profound dedication to teaching, characterized by his extensive experience, global impact, and unwavering commitment to student success,” said Provost, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Elizabeth Béjar. “His teaching philosophy not only imparts knowledge but also mentors and inspires students, preparing them to tackle global health challenges effectively. Dr. Barengo’s collaborations, dedication to mentorship, and significant research contributions represents the qualities celebrated by this honor.”
The Swiss-born researcher grew up in Finland, and after completing his university studies, set out on an international career. He conducted postdoctoral research in Spain. He worked with the Ministries of Health in Argentina, Paraguay, and Colombia, where he created a roadmap to diabetes prevention. And, he served as a consultant to the Pan American Health Organization.
His research focuses on population health and non-communicable diseases, emphasizing the prevention of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. He is involved in FIU's [Population Health Initiative](https://populationhealth.fiu.edu/), which brings together researchers from different disciplines to identify solutions that lead to improved health.

Here he is pictured with Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs at HWCOM Camilo Mora, who presented him with the award.
Barengo is also actively involved in professional organizations such as the American Public Health Association, the American Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes Federation, and America’s Network for Chronic Disease Surveillance. He has authored more than 170 peer-reviewed publications, with nearly half of his work co-authored by the students he has mentored. His research has earned more than 16,000 citations.
Barengo was chosen to become CUSA Professor of the Year from a group of 10 finalists who were nominated by their respective universities. Provosts from the CUSA institutions voted on the final winner.
Barengo says earning the award wasn’t just a victory for him.
“It’s a win for FIU,” Barengo says. “Everything that I achieve is possible because of FIU. This includes its students, faculty and administration. This is an example that if you give people the opportunities to develop professionally and personally, good things can and will happen.” 
Barengo teaches epidemiology, public health and research methods — a seminar-style course that demystifies medical research. Professors guide small groups of students as the group conducts an entire research project from start to finish.
Students flock to him — and his classes.
“Dr. Barengo is just incredibly supportive,” says third-year medical student Rima Avellan. She and her research group are receiving mentorship from Barengo as they work on a project to uncover if exercise can impact eye health in people with diabetes. “He’s very approachable. He has this calm demeanor about him that makes you want to talk to him. He feels like someone I can email five years down the road and say, ‘Hey, I’m working on this research. Can you help me with this?’ And he’d have no qualms about it. That’s the kind of down-to-earth, very genuine person he is.”

Most recently, Barengo expanded his chops as an educator and began teaching courses for freshmen within the FIU Honors College. These classes are interdisciplinary in nature and often combine perspectives in areas such as medicine, literature, history and architecture. Barengo also serves the university as the current chair of the Faculty Senate and, in that capacity, acts as a member of the FIU Board of Trustees.
“Noel participates so fully in faculty life,” says Pete Markowitz, associate dean of the Honors College and the faculty representative to the NCAA at FIU. “I’ve heard that the true definition of someone’s intelligence is when a person is able to thrive in a variety of areas. And Noel is that person. He thrives at everything. He works with his students and mentors them. He conducts research. He works with his colleagues. We’re proud of him earning this award.”
Fun fact: A former amateur hockey and tennis player, Barengo sometimes trains with one of the women’s tennis assistant coaches. He’s happy that the same year the women’s tennis team brought home the CUSA title for the third consecutive year, he brought in the CUSA Professor of the Year title.
