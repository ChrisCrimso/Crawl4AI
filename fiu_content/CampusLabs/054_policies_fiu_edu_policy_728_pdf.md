# 1110.025 Payment Card Processing Policy
[DownloadPolicy](https://policies.fiu.edu/files/728.pdf)
The University has a fiduciary responsibility to protect our customers' payment card information. Cardholder data is of high value to malicious individuals because the information can be used for fraudulent purposes. Therefore, we must ensure that appropriate safeguarding measures are in place to protect cardholder data and continuously demonstrate PCI DSS compliance.
The PCI DSS is a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing cardholder data security, which is intended to help organizations proactively protect cardholder data and was developed by the founding payment brands (i.e. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and JCB) of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. All payment card activity on behalf of FIU, at the University, or using FIU resources must comply with the PCI DSS. Failure to comply may result in fines, legal liability, reputation damage and loss of business.
