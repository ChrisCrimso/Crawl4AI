## About
A sport club is a group of students who meet regularly to pursue an interest in various sports activities, either competitively, instructionally, or recreationally. Many clubs offer the opportunity to compete against other schools at the state and national level through national governing bodies. Sport clubs are created and managed by students, providing unique opportunities for members to develop athletic and leadership skills; often the success of a Sport Club is dependent on the leadership abilities of club officers and members.
