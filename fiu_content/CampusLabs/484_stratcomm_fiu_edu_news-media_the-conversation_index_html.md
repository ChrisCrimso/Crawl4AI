## What is The Conversation?
[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) is a nonprofit, independent news organization that publishes articles written by academic experts for the general public. They provide a platform for academics, researchers, doctoral and postdoctoral students to share expertise and communicate research findings both inside and outside academia.
## FIU Research in The Conversation
More than 80 FIU researchers have written for The Conversation. Those articles have garnered more than 2 million views and have been republished by CNN, PBS, Scientific American and The Washington Post, among other top national and international news outlets.
FIU researchers have published on a wide array of subjects in The Conversation, from Professor Rokeshia Renné Ashley’s new perspective on Sarah Baartman to Professor Craig Austin’s breakdown of U.S. supply chain issues.
