NEE is designed to give you the necessary tools and resources for your career journey at FIU. Our goal is to help you understand FIU’s vision, mission, and values, as well as the benefits and opportunities associated with employment at the university.
Additional information regarding the date and time of NEE will be sent to you via email once you are registered. In order to get the most out of experience, we strongly encourage you to review the New Employee Resources below and come prepared with your questions.
