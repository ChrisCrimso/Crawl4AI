### The Work Number
The Work Number is available for FIU employees 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide automated employment and income verification.
The Work Number is a fast and secure way to provide proof of your employment or income; a necessary step in many of today’s life events including obtaining credit, financing a home or automobile, obtaining a housing lease or securing government benefits or services.
The Work Number complies with The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which ensures that employees can see who is requesting their data and provides a mechanism to dispute data that they believe to be inaccurate.
