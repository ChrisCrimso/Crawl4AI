While excited fans watched each turn of the 57-lap, 2025 Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium, FIU hospitality management students worked diligently behind-the-scenes.
[Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/) undergraduate student Justin Garay worked the big race for the third time. This year, he spent nearly a week helping sponsor Liquid I.V., an electrolyte drink mix powder, to help set up a functional hydration station and an immersive sensory experience that F1 fans got to interact with.
Garay worked as a brand assistant, helping with logistics, inventory and field marketing. He also coordinated with brand ambassadors, who handed out nearly 200,000 sample packets of the product. Garay says he found that the lessons he has learned in class, especially about teamwork and leadership, came in handy at the track.
“People just show up, but they don’t know the amount of work and hours it takes to put together a large, three-day event,” said Garay, who is just one class away from graduating with a [Bachelor's degree in events and entertainment management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/programs/undergraduate/bs-in-hospitality-management/events-entertainment-management/index.html). “It’s a team at the end of the day, so my event management and hospitality leadership classes helped me get prepared when I was on site, with event setup and the mindset of stepping up,” he added.

**Celebrity sightings**
Professional racing is a fan favorite, and in Miami the event is a mix of sports, entertainment, celebrity sightings and hospitality. Actor Timothée Chalamet and celebrity chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay were among those spotted. Inter Miami soccer player Sergio Busquets also showed up in the Exclusive F1 Paddock Club.
The latter is where Chaplin School alumna Izabella Jimenez ’25 reported to work this weekend just days after graduating with her Master's degree from the [mega event management](https://hospitality.fiu.edu/programs/graduate/ms-in-hospitality-management-with-specialization-in-mega-events/index.html) program. Jimenez has a new entry on her resume after overseeing the brand ambassadors working at the VIP venue. She served as a production assistant, helping with setup and making sure the experience ran smoothly,
The event was so exclusive, “I’m not even allowed to post it yet,” said Jimenez of restrictions placed on social sharing by those working the event.
She credits the opportunity to work F1 to connections the Chaplin School holds with high-level event planners and organizers throughout the industry.

**Say Cheese, Mr. Worldwide**
“Dale” could be Chaplin School marketing intern Marc Funes’ new favorite word. He has a stunning photo to add to his portfolio after getting a selfie with Mr. 305, a.k.a. Pitbull, during race weekend.
The sophomore undergraduate got a prime assignment as a guest experience photographer and videographer. His role during F1 included photographing and recording the guest experience team, who were in charge of interacting with F1 fans. He was one of two photographers hired by the Hard Rock for the duration of the race weekend.
He took photographs as Australia’s Oscar Piastri of the McLaren team took home the checkered flag and his fourth victory of the season to strengthen his lead in the F1 World Championship standings. Piastri’s McLaren teammate took home second place.
**Hands-on learning at the world’s biggest events**
Students have year-round opportunities to sign up to work at all kinds of large-scale and mega events hosted in Miami and across South Florida through the school’s unique mega events curriculum and its student club called [Back of House](https://fiubackofhouse.my.canva.site/back-of-house-website).
“You could say FIU hospitality students took home their own victory after helping to execute this prestigious and popular major sporting event,” said assistant teaching and lead events professor Sharifa Wilkinson.
The school also hosts the world-renowned [South Beach Wine & Food Festival®](https://sobewff.org/about-us/florida-international-university/), which began on campus and has grown to more than 100 individual events throughout the region and will mark its 25th anniversary next year. In addition, the school’s partnerships with major brands, venues and sporting and entertainment events, plus its prime location in Miami, gives students the chance to gain real hands-on experience before they even graduate.
Student Garay, with three F1 work experiences now under his belt, agrees that the school is prepping him for a great future. “It gave me all these experiences to put on my resume.”
