## Prospective Employees
### What are the different employment categories?
**ADMINISTRATIVE** positions are assigned administrative and management responsibilities or professional duties at the Department/Unit level, or above.
**EXECUTIVE SERVICE** positions ordinarily report directly to the President unless otherwise specified in writing, and include the Vice President and other positions responsible for policy making at the Executive level.
**STAFF** positions are assigned professional, paraprofessional, administrative, clerical, secretarial, technical, skilled crafts, service, or maintenance duties.
**TEMPORARY** employment is at will with fixed duration. Temporary jobs are organized into several categories, each with its own distinctive policies and procedures.
**FACULTY – REGULAR** usually resulting from a posting waiver or a successful search, a continuing appointment, which may or may not be term-limited or multiyear. Any regular, multiyear appointment may be renewed or changed to regular with no end date, during the employment of the faculty. These types of appointments may be full-time (40 standard hours) or part-time (less than 40 standard hours). Only regular faculty in the ranks of Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor are eligible for tenure. All other faculty ranks are non-tenure earning.
**FACULTY – VISITING** positions to be filled on a temporary basis. Usually appointments are for 1 year, with renewal availability for a maximum of 4 years. This type of faculty enjoys the same benefits as a regular faculty. When eligible, visiting faculty could be considered to receive any across the board increases, the same as regular faculty. Visiting faculty in all ranks are always non-tenure earning and shall meet the educational and professional experience as required for those ranks in the academic unit.
**FACULTY – CLINICAL** can be regular or visiting. The ranks for clinical faculty are: Clinical Instructor, Clinical Assistant Professor, Clinical Associate Professor and Clinical Professor. Clinical faculty are always non-tenure earning. Clinical faculty teach and/or are responsible for managing students in the practice component of their degree program.
**FACULTY – JOINT** appointment is defined as employment that is offered by two academic colleges, two academic units, or an academic unit and a center or institute. The offer letter will clearly designate the primary and secondary units. If tenure earning, the primary unit will be where the tenure will reside. Both the dean from the primary unit and the dean/director from the secondary unit will sign the letter. Only if the letter does not include specifics on the secondary assignment will a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) be required. Joint appointments are documented with secondary Appointment in the system.
**FACULTY – SECONDARY** appointment is given to current faculty or staff who request affiliation with another academic unit or who are invited to affiliate with another academic unit. This type of appointment is term limited with renewal possibility. Secondary appointments are documented in the Faculty Administrative Post, under Secondary Appointments. This type of appointment does not receive additional remuneration resulting from the affiliation. The offer letter is signed by both the dean from the secondary unit and the dean from the home academic unit.
**FACULTY – COURTESY** appointment is offered to a person who meets the academic unit’s professional qualifications but whose primary assignment is outside of the institution. The department will suggest the academic title or rank to be given to the candidate, based on their professional experience and education level. Courtesy appointments receive no financial remuneration, are term-limited and are always non-tenure earning.
**FACULTY – TEMPORARY** is non-tenure earning, non-benefit eligible employees. The period of employment is usually less than a year, but not more than a year if full-time, and come to complete a specific assignment. Usually assigned to less than 100% effort.

If the service is required for coursework at FIU, the person is considered a student and not a volunteer. Volunteers are classified as either a “regular-service volunteer” or an “occasional-service volunteer.” Solely for purposes of this policy, guest speakers, members of alumni or advisory boards for colleges and schools, and University Board of Trustees are not included in the definition of volunteer.
**Regular-Service Volunteers:** “Regular-service volunteer” means any person engaged in specific voluntary service activities on an ongoing or continuous basis. Examples of regular service volunteers include, but are not limited to, athletic team volunteers, student organization volunteer advisors, and library program volunteer counselors.

Student must be enrolled for a minimum of six credit hours in a course of study leading to a degree or a Financial Aid eligible certificate. FWS cannot work more than 20 hours per week in all total jobs on FIU payroll. FWS can work up to 30 hours per week only during Winter, Spring, and Summer Break.

The conditions are as follows: • Veterans with a VA service-connected disability • Spouses of veterans with permanent and total service-connected disability • Honorably discharged veterans with wartime service. • Unmarried widow or widower of a veteran who died as a result of a service-connected disability • A veteran who has served in a qualifying campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, to include the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. Florida International University honors this policy and will comply with Veterans’ Preference guidelines when filling staff positions. Veteran’s Preference must be requested during the application process. Any applicant claiming Veterans’ Preference will be required to attach a DD214 with each application submitted for verification and meet the Minimum requirements for the position Hiring departments must interview applicants claiming veteran’s preference provided that the applicant has not previously exercised their veterans’ preference status.
### Do I need to upload a DD214 form?
If indicating Veteran’s Preference when applying for a position, please upload your DD214 in the attachment section of the application so the recruiter can ensure that Veteran’s Preference is applicable. 
### What determines eligibility for veterans’ preference?
When veterans’ preference is indicated on your application, you will be considered for any “staff” level position that you apply to, given that you meet the minimum qualifications and provide verification of military service. 
### Will Veterans’ Preference guarantee an interview?
The hiring manager/department will contact you to schedule an interview for a “staff” level position if veterans’ preference is indicated on your application, you meet the minimum qualifications for that position and have provided your DD214 form verifying your military service and appropriate discharge.
### I do not have a college degree, will FIU consider me for a position?
While many positions require a minimum of a Bachelor’s degree, FIU has several positions that you may apply for. As an institute of learning, we encourage and support efforts to obtain a degree, or advanced degree, to anyone employed at FIU. Service members often use their military benefits to pursue their degree, but FIU also offers support with credit allowances for all employees through our benefit programs.
### What if I apply for a position other than “staff” level?
Veterans’ preference only applies to “staff” level positions. While we do value the experience of those who have military experience, an application will be considered solely based on the qualifications and requirements for that position. 
### What job areas are most applicable to my military experience?
FIU hires service members for all functional areas and departments. Service members have been found to be successful in engineering, customer service, operational roles and adjunct positions as well as many others based on previous education, experience and transferable skills. 
### Hiring Managers/Liaisons:

When veterans’ preference is indicated on an application, the candidate will be qualified for any “staff” level position where they meet the minimum qualifications and are able to provide verification of military service.

If veterans’ preference is indicated on an application, the candidate will upload a copy of their DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty which is issued upon retirement, separation or discharge from active duty) in the attachment section of the application. The recruiter will ensure that veterans’ preference is appropriate for that candidate by reviewing the DD214 form on the application. 
### What about military spouses?
A military spouse may also qualify for veterans’ preference if their spouse is on active duty, disabled due to a service connected injury or dies while on active duty. They will need to provide documentation as well as a legal document verifying their marriage status to the service member. They may have gaps in employment due to moving around to support their spouse’s military career, but may have a variety of valuable skills appropriate for specific positions.
### Are we required to interview all applicants who indicate Veterans’ Preference?
If veterans’ preference is indicated on the application (see column Vet Pref and “Y” or “N”), they meet the minimum qualifications and have provided a DD214 form verifying their military service and appropriate discharge, the recruiter will qualify that candidate for your position. If it is a “staff” level position, the department will contact the candidate(s) to schedule an interview and your recruiter or another representative from TAM will need to be included and attend ALL interviews for that position, not just for the veteran(s) being considered for that position. 
### What if we are hiring for a position other than “staff” level?
Veterans’ preference only applies to “staff” level positions. While we do value the experience of those who have military experience, an application will be considered solely based on the qualifications and requirements for that position.
### What job areas are most applicable to military experience and transferable skills?
FIU makes a pro-active effort to engage and recruit service members for all functional areas and departments.

## Mid-Year Checkpoint FAQs
  * “Why am I seeing the PEP document for 2024-2025, the fiscal year isn’t over yet?” 
    * To encourage conversations between supervisors and their team members, PEP documents will be available in PantherSoft HR by the end of March-2025. This will allow supervisors to revisit goals, document accomplishments, and account for shifting priorities.
  * When is the PEP actually due? 
    * The PEP deadline is September 30th, 2025.
  * Do I need to submit or do anything in PantherSoft? 
    * Supervisors should log into the PEP documents and review/revise goals as needed. Please note: PEP documents for the 2024-2025 cycle do not need to be completed until the September 30, 2025 deadline.
  * How do I update my goals? 
    * Goals may be updated by editing the comments in the text box located below the title of each goal.
  * Can employees edit their own goals? 
    * Only supervisors have access to edit comments, add, or remove goals in the Manager Evaluation. Any edits that employees make on the Self-Evaluation in the Goals Section, will not be reflected in Manager Evaluation. However, employees are encouraged to review/revise their goals and document their progress on their self-evaluation in preparation for the mid-year checkpoint discussion with their supervisor.
  * What if the goals have not changed since they were set? 
    * Supervisors should review goal progress and discuss them with their team members. For example: If the employee has only attended 5 professional development hours in the last six months, discuss how they will achieve the remaining 15 by the end of the fiscal year.
  * Should I delete the goals that are no longer relevant? 
    * It is recommended that managers DO NOT delete the goals, but just state in the comments that “the goal has been removed/or delayed to the following year due to shifting priorities”. This helps make sure that past goals are documented, even if they are currently no longer relevant.
  * Can I add new goals? 
    * Yes. New goals may be added to Section 2 – Previous Year’s Goals and Accomplishments, by clicking on the plus sign at the bottom of the section.
  * Do I need to have a conversation with my employee if there any adjustments to the goals? 
    * Yes. Having a conversation is vital as employees should be aware of any changes made to the goals they are accountable for and have an opportunity to provide feedback before they are set.
  * Should I enter comments in the competencies section? 
    * Entering comments in Section 3 – Competencies will save you time at the end of the fiscal year when the PEPs are due. It will also help you recall events that occurred in the first six months of the fiscal year.
  * Where can I find more resources about the PEP? 
    * Shortcuts for the Manager PEP Toolkit and Employee PEP Toolkits are located on the main HR website (hr.fiu.edu). The toolkits contain step-by-step instructions, templates, and links to PEP webinars.

### Why are students only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours a week? 
The 20 hour limit for student employees is a directive from the Office of the Provost. The rationale is that the student’s primary focus should be on their academic role. This also allows them to be exempt from Social Security and Medicare tax while being a student employee.
### Can my student ever work more than 20 hours a week?
Yes. During the semester breaks (winter break, spring break, and summer break) students can work a maximum of 30 hours a week.
### Is there a training for FWS and Student Employees recruiting and hiring?
Yes. A separate in-person or webinar for FWS Employment and Student Employment is provided annually in the second week of July. Email communications are sent out to HR Liaisons and hiring managers on our email listserv at least three weeks in advance. The webinars are also posted on the HR site under hiring FWS employees.
### Who determines rate of pay for the FWS posting?
FWS posting rates of pay are assigned by TAM-HR based on specific responsibilities and qualifications stipulated in the job description as aligned with the federal student aid requirements.
### What should I do if my FWS activity number does not populate on the FWS Hire Form?
If the activity number is not populated, it may need to be activated by Financial Aid. The department must email Adelfa Ukenye, Assistant Director Financial Aid, and request the number be activated.
### How do I know if I am using the correct FWS Hire form?
Before submitting the [FWS Hire form](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2016_FWS_Employment_Webinar.pdf), the preparer must ensure that the current academic year is populating on the top right-hand corner of the form.
### Can a FWS employee also hold a position as a regular Student Assistant employee?
Yes, if it is not for the same job as the FWS position in the same department, and if the total hours between the jobs do not exceed 20 hours a week.
### Does the FWS record have to be the same pay rate as the Student Assistant record?
If the student is performing the same job functions on the student employee record during breaks from the FWS record, the rate of pay MUST be the same for both.
### How do I hire FWS employees during the spring semester?
A Spring Hiring Toolkit with steps required to onboard your spring candidate is available and can be found on the [HR site](https://hr.fiu.edu/leadership/recruitment-onboarding/#recruiting-FWS-employees) to assist departments when hiring FWS employees. 
### How do I hire FWS employees during the summer semester?
An email communication from Financial Aid with a FWS summer spreadsheet to express interest to rehire or hire is disseminated every Spring along with a Summer Hiring Toolkit. The toolkit details the steps required to onboard your summer candidate is posted on the HR site to assist departments when hiring FWS employees.
### If my student employee graduates, can they remain an FWS or Student Assistant in the system?
No. They must be terminated effective immediately. If your Budget Manager approves to hire them on a Temporary Appointment, then you must advertise the position and start the Hiring Temporary Employee recruitment process. They will be subject to clear a level I or II background check (if applicable). Their one-year employment clock will also begin.
### Can I hire an international student to work without them having been issued a Social Security Number (SSN) from the Social Security Administration?
No. An international student who has not been issued a SSN may not begin working until they received a SSN and have card in hand, but may apply to any student assistant posting on the Careers site. If selected as a finalist, it is the responsibility of the student to immediately initiate the process for securing a SSN with the hiring department and [International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) Office.](https://globalaffairs.fiu.edu/isss/)
### Student Assistants
### What is the criteria to hire a candidate as a student employee?
The student candidate must be enrolled at FIU at least part-time six (6) credits undergraduate or three (3) credits graduate.
### Why are all students only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours a week?
The 20 hour limit for student employees is a directive from the Office of the Provost. The rationale is that the student’s primary focus should be on their academic role. This also allows them to be exempt from Social Security and Medicare tax while being a student employee.
### Can my student ever work more than 20 hours a week?
Yes. During the semester breaks (winter break, spring break, and summer break) students can work a maximum of 30 hours a week. The system, however, must continue to reflect only the maximum of 20 hours a week for all total jobs on FIU payroll.
### If my student employee graduates, can they remain a student employee in the system?
No. Upon graduation, student employment ends and they must be terminated effective the end of an upcoming pay period. If your Budget Manager approves to hire them on a Temporary Appointment, then you must advertise the position and start the Hiring Temporary Employee recruitment process. There is no guarantee of no gap in employment and they will be subject to clear a level I or II background check (if applicable). Their one-year employment clock will also begin.
### Can I hire an international student to work without them having been issued a Social Security Number (SSN) from the Social Security Administration?
No. An international student who has not been issued a SSN cannot receive an official job offer to start working until they receive a SSN and have card in hand, but can apply to any student employee posting on the Careers site for consideration. If selected as a finalist, it is the responsibility of the student to immediately initiate the process for securing a SSN with the hiring department and [International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) Office.](https://globalaffairs.fiu.edu/isss/)
### Temporary
### What does “exempt” mean?
Employees in exempt positions do not receive overtime pay no matter how many hours they work in a workweek. Since they do not receive overtime pay, there is no need for them to keep records of the specific hours they work.
### What does “non-exempt” mean?
Employees who work in non-exempt positions are not exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). They keep records of the specific times they work so that they are paid overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the employee’s hourly rate.
### How do I know if an assignment is exempt or non-exempt?
Very specific criteria must be met for a position to be designated as exempt. If the criteria, or tests, cannot be met then the position is non-exempt. Here are some of the main criteria or tests: • If the position is teaching or conducting research in chosen field of study, the position is exempt. This applies to adjuncts and teaching/research assistants. • If the position has a total salary of not less than $684 per week the position may be exempt; however, additional criteria must be met. • If the salary requirement is met, there are a variety of other criteria that may dictate whether a position is exempt or non-exempt. Please contact our Compensation Administration department at cmpadmin@fiu.edu for detailed information.
### Do non-exempt employees complete a timesheet?
Yes. All non-exempt employees will receive access to a timesheet in the PantherSoft HR system to report hours worked daily. After their sign-on packet has been processed, the HR Liaison and Supervisor will receive the onboarding email with the new employee log in information, subject: “FIU MyAccounts HR On-Boarding Automated Notification Program” from the Division of Information Technology. As a non-exempt employee, the employee would enter their start time and end time for each day worked. If an employee on a temporary appointment works through their lunch period, the manager must adjust their time.
Supervisors must approve employee time by 2:00 p.m. the Monday after the payroll closing week via PantherSoft HR. The payroll deadlines can be accessed via the [HR calendar.](https://hr.fiu.edu/payroll-calendars-schedules/) Since exempt employees are paid on a bi-weekly basis, they are not required to interact with a timesheet in the PantherSoft HR system.
### Can I hire a Temporary employee who is under the age of 18 (minor)?
Yes. A department can hire someone who is between the age of 14 and 17, however all employees intending to work directly with the minor are required to complete and clear a Level II background (criminal background check + fingerprinting) prior to the minor being able to start working.
### Does a minor complete the same sign-on packet as one who is of legal age?
Yes. A new hire who is a minor will complete the same new employee sign-on packet. However, there are certain forms in the packet that will need to be signed by their parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian should come in person with the new hire to complete and submit this paperwork to HR.
