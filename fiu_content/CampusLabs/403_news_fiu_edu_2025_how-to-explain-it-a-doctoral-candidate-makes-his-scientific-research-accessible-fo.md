FIU annually hosts its version of the Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition, a gathering of graduate students who present their thesis/dissertation projects to an audience and panel of judges. The event, for which entrants prepare for months, aims to improve the communication skills of young researchers by taking them through the process of "translating," or making relatable, the research they do so that anyone might understand its significance. Daniel Martinez Perez is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work](https://stempel.fiu.edu/) whose presentation on his Alzheimer's investigation won him first place at the campus competition this year and advanced him to the national contest.
Perez is investigating TSPO, a biomarker of neuroinflammation, and its role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Early findings show that TSPO levels increase well before memory loss occurs, offering hope for early detection and improved treatments. 
He shares his experience as a researcher and competitor.
**How did you get started studying Alzheimer's?**
I started studying Alzheimer's as a master's degree student when I joined a group of neuroscientists in Antioquia, Colombia. The research group has been studying a Colombian family with a rare mutation for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. The members of this family develop Alzheimer's in their 40s and die in their 50s.
I understood that one of the most important challenges with this disease is to obtain an early diagnosis before the onset of the illness. I decided to continue with this work by pursuing a Ph.D. and now am working in [Tomás R. Guilarte](https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/profiles/guilarte-tomas-r.html)'s lab at FIU where I have been studying the role of a protein called TSPO in the progression of Alzheimer's as a potential early biomarker and therapeutic target.

**What was your experience like preparing for 3MT? What was the most challenging part?**
Preparing myself for 3MT was an enriching and challenging experience. I am grateful to the University Graduate School team because they trained me and all the participants and helped us throughout the process with several coaching sessions.
One of the most challenging parts for me as a student and scientist was to be able to explain my research in just three minutes in a way that the non-scientific public would be able to understand and how to tell a story that would be attractive to the attendees and judges. I know that communication with the non-scientific public is one of the most problematic aspects for scientists, and I think that this event helped me to improve my skills. 
**What was it like competing at the national level?**
Competing at the national level at the Conference Southern Graduate Schools 2025 in Dallas was an amazing and thrilling experience. I met and learned from a diversity of students from across the United States who are doing interesting and impactful research. I think that this event helped me to improve as a professional, as a student, a scientist and a human being.
**What would you tell fellow students about the importance of communicating your research?**
My research has the potential of impacting the lives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families by helping with an early diagnosis and the design of new therapeutic target. The 3MT experience has taught me that communication is crucial both within the scientific community and with the general public, which in the end should benefit from it.
I also learned the necessity of communicating in a way that can inspire future researchers as well as enhance one's own career. I truly recommend participating in such events.
