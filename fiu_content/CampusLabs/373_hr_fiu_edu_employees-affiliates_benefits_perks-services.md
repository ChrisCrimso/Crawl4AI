# Employee Perks & Services
![](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/top_banner_perks.png)
FIU is a great place to work. The Employee Perks & Services Program is just one of many benefits offered at FIU. As a benefit of your employment with the university, you have access to discounts from hundreds of local and national vendors. Receiving your discounts is easy. Most vendors just need to see your [FIU One Card](https://onecard.fiu.edu/) or offer an online coupon code. However, be sure to read each discount carefully, as they may not apply to everyone or have specific requirements. We thank you for making FIU Worlds Ahead!
Be sure to periodically visit the Employee Perks & Services home web page to learn about additional HR perks. This website will be updated on a regular basis.
The Division of Human Resources has provided this list of links because they contain information which may be of interest to our FIU employees. We offer these links without endorsement. Individuals who choose to use the links should understand that they are offered only as a convenience and FIU takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided at these sites. Vendors interested in joining the program should view the Vendor Information page.
FIU will not obtain nor distribute personally identifying information about its faculty or staff visiting the site. Further, FIU does not exercise any editorial control over the information you may find at these locations. While FIU has done business with many of these vendors, employee participation and utilization of any referenced products and/or services is completely voluntary.

The _Public Service Loan Forgiveness_(PSLF) Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments have been made under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. You must meet your employer’s definition of full-time. If you are employed by a government or not-for-profit organization, you may be able to receive loan forgiveness under the PSLF Program.
**How do I know I’m on the right track to receive PSLF?**
Because you have to make 120 qualifying monthly payments, it will take at least 10 years for you to become eligible for PSLF. To help you determine if you are on the right track as early as possible, we have created an [**Employment Certification for Public Service Loan Forgiveness form**](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/public-service-loan-forgiveness-application) that you can submit periodically while you are working toward meeting the PSLF eligibility requirements.
