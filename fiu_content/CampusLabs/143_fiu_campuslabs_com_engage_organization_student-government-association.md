# Student Government Association
## About
Student Government Association (SGA) is the organization that represents the voices of the FIU students. Our purpose is to serve as the governing body responsible for representing the students' interests as well as addressing student needs on matters of University, county and state concerns. SGA works closely with other student organizations and councils, in addition to being responsible for the allocation of $20 million in student fees.
