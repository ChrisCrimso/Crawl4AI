# Performance Management
## Providing Feedback
Providing feedback to employees is an important responsibility for all supervisors and an integral part of performance development. Supervisors are expected to provide continuous feedback throughout the year, not only during the annual Performance Evaluation Process (PEP). The PEP is an important process and tool that should summarize the conversations held throughout the fiscal year. Feedback includes both positive and constructive communication to guide employees and provide tools to succeed. Employees are more likely to be motivated when they have confidence that their supervisor is measuring both successes and challenges.
Feedback should be timely and ongoing, descriptive of actions and expectations, and include achievable action items. It is a collaborative effort intended to help the employee.
### Tips for Providing Feedback
  1. Feedback sessions should include a dialogue between two people – provide an opportunity for the other party to respond and invite him/her to also provide feedback in return.
  2. Make your feedback specific and related to behavior; do not personalize.
  3. Give the feedback in objective terms and in a calm and unemotional manner.
  4. Consider your timing; provide prompt feedback with both recognition and praise or guidance and expectations.
  5. Focus on behavior the employee can change.
  6. Define the impact on you, the team, the department, and the university.
  7. Consider memorializing the discussion in writing, as appropriate.


## Performance Excellence Process (PEP)
FIU is committed to helping employees understand what is expected of them, perform to those expectations, and develop professionally. The Performance Excellence Process (PEP) is a cornerstone in our efforts to build a performance-oriented culture that promotes annual planning and assessment on a common anniversary date. It reinforces the university‘s institutional value of “Strategic, Operational and Service Excellence.” PEP is intended to foster a productive and collaborative work environment, effective communication between employees and supervisors, and timely, regular, and meaningful feedback that ensures mutual understanding of performance expectations.
Managers of full-time employees (out of unit), PBA (non-probationary) and FNA (non-probationary) will receive an evaluation template through PantherSoft HR. The PEP will be completed, submitted, and approved online. Employees will also provide their own self-evaluation using PantherSoft HR.

If you manage faculty, please contact the dean’s office of your department or college for more information regarding your Unit’s Faculty Evaluation process.
## Manager PEP Toolkit
![PEP image](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PEP_image.jpg)The Manager PEP Toolkit was created for Managers of full-time employees (out of unit), PBA (non-probationary) and FNA (non-probationary) as a resource to assist them in completing the PEP.

## Promotion Process
If you have interest in promoting an employee, you should contact your assigned HR Liaison who will assist you with the process. Once approved by your department, Compensation Administration will be contacted by the HR Liaison for further review. It is important to note that discussions should not be held with the impacted employee prior to receiving the required approvals.
In determining the salary increase for promotions, a Compensation Administration representative will consider the following factors:
  * Budget
  * Market Conditions
  * Candidate’s credentials (skills, experience, performance knowledge, and education) for the job weighed against the minimum qualifications required and the relevant credentials of others in the same position.


## Managing Performance
A primary objective of every supervisor is to communicate, consistently apply, set, and regularly review the expected performance standards for each employee. A supervisor should acknowledge when employees perform well and provide appropriate timely feedback.
However, when an employee fails to meet the expected standards after the supervisor has provided appropriate feedback, the supervisor is responsible for escalating his/her concerns to Employee & Labor Relations (ELR). Several options are available in addressing performance concerns depending on the issue, such as counseling, mediation, and/or discipline. Disciplinary options will vary on a case by case basis. Therefore, it is imperative that ELR is contacted prior to any disciplinary action being taken.
## Demotion Process
An action resulting in a demotion of an employee, whether based on performance or based on organizational restructure, requires contact with Employee & Labor Relations for review and compliance. If approved, further review will be conducted by the Compensation Administration to determine the appropriate job code, title, and adjusted salary, if applicable. It is important to note that discussions should not be held with the impacted employee prior to receiving the required approvals.
