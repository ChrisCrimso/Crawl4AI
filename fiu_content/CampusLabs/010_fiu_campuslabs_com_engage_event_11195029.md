## Description
Attend our bi-monthly information session to learn more about the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences Accelerated Option BSN program.
The U.S. Department of Labor’s growth outlook for RN jobs by the year 2024 is more than double the growth rate for all occupations. It’s why many are considering a career – or a career change – in nursing. And it’s why FIU Nursing created the **Accelerated Option Bachelor of Science in Nursing (AO BSN)**.
