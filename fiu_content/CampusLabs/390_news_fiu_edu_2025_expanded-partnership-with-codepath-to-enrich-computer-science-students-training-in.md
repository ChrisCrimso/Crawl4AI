CodePath – an organization teaming up with higher education institutions to develop the first generation of AI-native engineers, CTOs, and founders – announced it has selected Florida International University as [one of four campus partners nationwide to implement its Emerging Engineer Empowerment Program](https://www.codepath.org/student/fiu). This formal collaboration will provide computer science students access to career readiness workshops, mentorship opportunities, and CodePath’s cutting-edge computer science curriculum, which trains aspiring professionals to be leaders in the technology sector.
![CodePath logo](https://news.fiu.edu/2025/_assets/codepathlogo.jpg)FIU is a longtime partner of CodePath, connecting students to its industry-backed courses, invitation-only career fairs with Fortune 500 companies and leadership opportunities through the [Career and Talent Development department](https://career.fiu.edu) since 2020. The collaboration complements the world-class education offered by the [FIU Knight Foundation School of Computing & Information Sciences](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/), helping students apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to real-world settings while connecting them with mentors, internships and job opportunities with CodePath’s industry-leading corporate partners, including, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and more.
“Since 2020, over 1,000 FIU students have participated in CodePath courses and programming. Our expanded collaboration will further integrate industry-aligned curriculum into FIU coursework and expand career pathways,” said Michael Ellison, CEO and Co-Founder of CodePath. “We will continue to ensure our strategic plan and growth exponentially advances FIU’s initiatives.”
![Two codepath alumni speak on a panel with a moderator](https://news.fiu.edu/2025/_assets/codepath-alumni.jpg)FIU computer science students Jude Surin, center, and Robert Velasquez, right, discuss their experience in the CodePath program with Emmanuela Stanislaus, a career liaison at CodePath. With the skills learned through CodePath, Surin was selected as a Pathways Fellow at Apple and Velasquez has accepted a full-time position at Google beginning after graduation. 
Additionally, FIU students will now have the opportunity to enroll in a new, for-credit course through the university covering technical interviewing skills. Taught by a software engineer in partnership with FIU faculty, this course empowers students to ace technical interviewing and gives them a preview of real-world challenges in the industry. The course is designed to help students become self-sufficient learners, learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and approaches, and solve challenging algorithmic problems commonly used in interviews for top companies.
“Through our collaboration with CodePath, FIU students have gained access to resources that are significantly enhancing their competitiveness in the computer science field. With tailored career support, this partnership has enabled students to launch their careers – connecting them to internships and directly to full-time opportunities – demonstrating the transformative impact of intentional, industry-aligned training,” said Bridgette Cram, Vice President of Student Success Operations and Integrated Planning at FIU. “We look forward to seeing more FIU students take advantage of this opportunity over the next academic year as we commence our journey as a CodePath campus partner.”
With advanced skills in artificial intelligence and other in-demand technical disciplines under their belt, CodePath alumni earn a median starting salary of $93,000. Numerous FIU students and graduates are represented among CodePath’s 30,000 alumni, including Ayleen Roa, who secured a paid technical internship at Universal Studios for Spring 2025 after completing the program. 
“From who I was a year ago to who I am today, I have grown immensely as a programmer, and I can thank CodePath for a huge part of it. I am so grateful for all the skills I’ve learned through CodePath and all the guidance I received,” Roa said.
She shared this advice for fellow students: “I wouldn't be where l am or have this internship if I decided never to start CodePath. So, I recommend you do the same – take your first step into a bigger and better version of yourself and join CodePath.”
 _FIU students who are interested in enrolling in CodePath’s and FIU’s programming, including the Technical Interview Prep course, can learn more on the_[ _CodePathxFIU webpage_](https://www.codepath.org/student/fiu) _. Computer Science students who have completed Data Structures and Algorithms are eligible for this course pending approval from FIU faculty. The course will be available beginning in the Summer 2025 semester._
