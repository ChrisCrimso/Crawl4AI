## Next is Now - Future Focused Literacies
As a higher education institution that promises a world of possibilities, it is imperative we harness our talent in order to deliver the best learning experience for our students and foster a conducive environment for research. The changing landscape of work and higher education offers a unique opportunity for us to capitalize on the fast pace of change and prepare administrators and staff of our university community to support the long-term vision of our FIU. To that end, we have committed to embrace three literacies—data literacy, technical literacy, and human literacy– as focus areas to ensure we build strength among our employees. 
Literacies
[](javascript:;)
**Data literacy** is the ability to read, understand, create and communicate data as information. Much like literacy as a general concept, data literacy focuses on the competencies involved in working with data. As data collection and data sharing become routine and data analysis and big data become common ideas in the news, business, government and society, it becomes more and more important for students, citizens, and readers to have some data literacy. 
[](javascript:;)
**Technological literacy** is the ability to effectively use technology to access, evaluate, integrate, create and communicate information to enhance the learning process through problem-solving and critical thinking. 
[](javascript:;)
**Human literacy** focuses on giving power to communicate, engage with others, and tap into human capacity in a way that includes elements of the arts, especially design, which is integral to much of digital communication. 
## Professional Development
Policy
Our existing policy currently requires 20 hours of professional development for admin and staff. The university has updated the requirement for professional development to include a minimum of 10 hours toward data literacy, technological literacy, or human literacy.
### Opportunities for Professional Development
At FIU There are several paths through which these literacies can be achieved. Participation in online learning, conferences, readings, etc., are all viable resources to accomplish the professional development requirements. Opportunities, online or in-person can be found in the following locations:
  * [Develop.fiu.edu](https://develop.fiu.edu/) – FIU’s new home for professional development offers training in a variety of modalities (fully online, webinar supporting, and in-person supporting courses) ranging from compliance, to safety, to managing a remote workforce.
  * [linkedinlearning.fiu.edu](http://linkedinlearning.fiu.edu) – linkedinlearning.fiu.edu is a leading online learning platform that enables FIU faculty, staff, and students to discover and develop skills through an online library of high-quality expert-led videos.
  * [calendar.fiu.edu](https://calendar.fiu.edu/) – There are a variety of lecture series, internal conferences, and events offered to the FIU community.


## Helpful Information

### Using LinkedIn Learning
LinkedIn Learning (linkedinlearning.fiu.edu) is a leading online learning platform that enables FIU faculty, staff, and students to discover and develop skills through an online library of high-quality expert-led videos.
