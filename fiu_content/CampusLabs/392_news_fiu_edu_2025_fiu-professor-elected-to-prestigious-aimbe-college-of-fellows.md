FIU College of Engineering and Computing Professor Anuradha Godavarty has been elected to join the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) College of Fellows. AIMBE Fellows represent the top medical and biological engineers in the country, making it a highly selective honor that recognizes exceptional contributions to the field.
The AIMBE election process is rigorous and peer-driven, requiring nomination by existing Fellows and thorough evaluation of a candidate's research, innovation and leadership contributions.
"Being elected to the AIMBE College of Fellows is truly humbling. This recognition represents not just my work, but the dedication of my entire research team at FIU's [Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://oil.fiu.edu/) who have helped transform our ideas into real technologies that create value for people,” Godavarty says.
Currently, Godavarty and her group of researchers are developing near infrared-based optical imaging technologies for various clinical applications such as wound monitoring, especially around diabetic foot ulcers, and peripheral vascular imaging related to cardiovascular diseases.
Godavarty was elected by the College of Fellows for her “pioneering research from bench-to-bedside of near-infrared optical-based medical devices and translating to breast cancer and diabetes-related wound management.” She was inducted along with 171 colleagues who make up the AIMBE College of Fellows Class of 2025 this month.
"Dr. Godavarty's trailblazing work in optical imaging technologies exemplifies the innovative research that has made our department one of the top 50 public programs for biomedical engineering in the country,” says Jorge Riera, Associate Professor and Interim Chair of FIU’s Department of Biomedical Engineering.
“Her successful transformation of research from theoretical concepts to practical healthcare solutions not only advances critical medical interventions but also enhances our reputation as a leader in biomedical engineering.”
