Eleven-year-old Hayden Thomas enjoys playing tennis with his sister Madilynn. He can even serve the ball, thanks in part to a novel exercise program incorporating use of a body-powered 3D-printed prosthetic hand.
Designed to help patients better manage everyday tasks, the program offers hope for more convenient, cost-effective therapy options for children with congenital upper limb deficiencies.
Hayden’s mom, physical therapist [Amanda Thomas](https://cnhs.fiu.edu/about/faculty-staff/profiles/amthomas.html) in the[ Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences](https://cnhs.fiu.edu/), and her [Doctor of Physical Therapy](https://cnhs.fiu.edu/academics/physical-therapy/programs/d-physical-therapy/) students created the at-home program in which Hayden’s strength, range of motion and coordination improved markedly. His 3D-printed hand was created at [FIU’s Miami Beach Urban Studios](https://carta.fiu.edu/mbus/), and the pattern for the adult-sized hand was modified with assistance from university biomedical engineers.
Thomas’s study has received global interest since its publication in the [Journal of Hand Therapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36402711/)
