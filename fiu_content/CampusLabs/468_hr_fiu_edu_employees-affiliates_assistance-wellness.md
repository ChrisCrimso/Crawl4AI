![Image of a binder with a label that says confidential](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OEA_confidential-300x187.jpg)
The OEA carefully adheres to professional standards of ethics and confidentiality. Appointments and services are confidential to the fullest extent permitted by law. Legal exceptions are fully discussed in the initial consultation session. Except when legally mandated to breach confidentiality, no information is released without the specific, written consent of the individual. Information maintained by the OEA staff is not part of, or accessible by any other university record system.The OEA operates with scheduled appointments, and does not communicate personal information via e-mail without specific, written consent of the individual, as we cannot assure the confidentiality of that medium.
### The OEA Experience - Help Within Reach
As much as we would like to separate our work life from our personal problems, it is often difficult to do so. Our mission is to enhance the quality of life of active and retired FIU faculty and staff and their immediate family members, improve personal effectiveness, and to create a healthier campus community by providing mental health assessments, brief interventions and/or referrals, small group facilitations, crisis responses, and customized educational and training programs.
All student employees should contact the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. For information about walk-in hours at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus, call (305) 348-2277, and the Biscayne Bay Campus, call (305) 919-5305.
### Services
![Image of a consultant helping a young woman and a young man](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OEA_services-300x200.jpg)The OEA offers services including consultations, professional assessments, interventions, and/or referrals depending upon the nature of the problem and the specific circumstances. You will be able to consult with an experienced clinician who will listen to your concerns, discuss and explore your options, and work with you to determine a plan of action.
At the OEA, we utilize a brief problem-resolution focused model of intervention. Our services begin with an assessment of the presenting issues and concerns. Based upon that assessment we will make recommendations. If the OEA professional determines that the brief intervention model will be appropriate for your presenting problems or concerns, an OEA clinician will provide an intervention without charge. When the issues are beyond the scope of this brief model, appropriate referrals to community-based services will be provided to you. Your health insurance may help defray most or some of the cost of services.
Many people delay seeking help until problems pile up. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness nor personal flaw. Everyone needs help with something at one time or another.
Feelings can be a useful guide to deciding when to reach out for help. If you are experiencing any of the following feelings more often than you would like, do not let self-doubt keep you from consulting with the OEA:
  * Distressed, upset, hurt
  * Sad, depressed
  * Helpless, confused, stuck
  * Anxious, worried, suspicious
  * Over-stressed, fatigued
  * Guilty, ashamed


Any problem or concern that is bothering you is appropriate to discuss with us.
### Issues
Some people have difficulty in contacting a resource for personal issues or deciding whether it may be beneficial. The OEA professionals often talk with people experiencing a range of personal, family, or work-related problems including:
  * Marital and relationship difficulties
  * Family issues, parent-child concerns, eldercare challenges
  * Psychological distress – anxiety/depression
  * Alcohol and drug concerns
  * Workplace adjustment challenges
  * Career issues, work conflicts, burnout, retirement

### Support and other FIU Community Groups

### Management Consultation Services for Supervisors
![](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OEA_conflict_resolution-300x200.jpg)The OEA lends support to managers when addressing employee behaviors of concern. Management consultations can be geared toward supporting the manager experiencing the situation and/or how to assist the impacted employee(s). Management consultation is a voluntary service.
Management consultations can be offered in person or by phone at either the Modesto A. Maidique Campus or the Biscayne Bay Campus. An initial appointment can be arranged by calling the OEA at (305) 348-2469. Appointments are usually scheduled between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, alternative arrangements may be made upon request. If you call and do not reach us in person, please leave a message. In addition, the OEA staff may make arrangements to travel to other locations for consultations, as needed.
### Employee Assistance Services
There are three types of employee referrals to the OEA:
  * Employee Self-referral
  * Informal Supervisory referrals
  * Formal/Mandatory referrals


[A Quick Guide to using the Office of Employee Assistance for Department Heads & Supervisors.](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OEA_Referrals_Basic_Guide_Supervisors.pdf)
### Education & Support Conversation
Speak with your employees regularly about the services and aid that the OEA can provide. When it is apparent that an employee is troubled or distressed, a supervisor should encourage the use of the OEA services.
### Informal Supervisory Referral
A supervisor should informally refer an employee to the OEA after consulting with Employee & Labor Relations (ELR) when job performance is impacted to a minor degree. The supervisor may be advised to simply offer the employee the suggestion to seek assistance from the OEA. However, when the impact on job performance is substantial, the supervisor will be coached by ELR as to how to make the supervisory referral and communicate this effectively to the employee. In instances where the employee permits it, supervisors may receive information about the employee’s participation in an assessment and their participation and engagement with any interventions that the OEA may recommend.
### Formal Supervisory Referral
When it is apparent that the employee is troubled or distressed and the supervisor detects a change in the employee’s on-the-job behavior or decline in job performance, a supervisor should formally refer an employee to the OEA after consultation with ELR. It is not the supervisor’s job to attempt to diagnose problems, and it is important that the supervisor maintain the boundaries of the supervisory relationship. As part of the supervisory role, it is reasonable to formally suggest that the employee seek services from the OEA. This is appropriate when patterned absences, unusual mood changes, or clear and apparent decreases in performance are observed. The OEA professional will only provide information regarding participation in the OEA program to the supervisor and ELR representative with the written request of the employee to release information.
A formal/mandatory referral to the OEA requires an employee to participate in the OEA as a condition of continued employment. This type of referral is made only in extreme cases of deteriorating job performance where the individual’s continued employment is brought into question. This type of referral is initiated with the consultation of the OEA, the General Counsel’s Office, ELR, or other administrative entities as determined by university policy.
For formal supervisory referrals you need to print and complete the [Supervisor Referral Form ](https://hr.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Supervisor-Referral-Form-052516.pdf)and fax it to (305) 348-3903.

### Program Overview
The Faculty & Staff Behavioral Intervention Team ([FASTeam](https://hr.fiu.edu/fasteam/)) is a hybrid of a behavioral intervention team and a threat assessment team.

In order to promote a campus that is safe, the goal of the [FASTeam](https://hr.fiu.edu/fasteam/), in conjunction with the student-focused Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT), is to provide an integrated and coordinated process for identifying and responding to students, faculty, staff and other individuals who may be at risk of harming themselves or others. Achieving this goal involves:
  * Utilizing a multidisciplinary team to review, identify and develop specific intervention/prevention strategies.
  * Collecting and organizing information to facilitate communication on and off campus.
  * Analyzing information, discerning patterns, and following up as appropriate.
  * Providing education and training to faculty, staff and students in how to identify and address concerning behaviors that may need further assessment or response.

  * Fire in primary residence of a faculty or staff member.
