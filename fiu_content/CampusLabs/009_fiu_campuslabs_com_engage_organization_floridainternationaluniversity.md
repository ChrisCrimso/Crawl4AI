## About
Student Experiences provides oversight to student agencies and bureaus (BSU, Homecoming, ISU, Panther Power, RSO Council, and SPC), as well as registered student organizations on campus. 
Campus Life also promotes **Hazing Prevention** for students involved in any activity on campus. 
Hazing is a violation of the FIU Student Code of Conduct. Hazing is defined as any group or individual action or activity that inflicts or intends to inflict physical or mental harm or discomfort or which may demean, disgrace, or degrade any person, regardless of location, intent, or consent of participant(s). Hazing includes, but is not limited to, forced consumption of any food, alcohol, controlled substances, drugs, or any other substance, forced physical activity, deprivation of food or sleep, physical abuse of any nature, and verbal abuse, including yelling or demands.
For more information about Hazing Prevention, the mandatory student training, or to report a hazing incident, please visit the **[FIU Hazing Prevention](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/student-conduct-and-academic-integrity/hazing-and-prevention/index.html)** site.
Our offices are located on the MMC Campus in GC2240 and on the BBC Campus in WUC 141.
