Program Description
The English major empowers students by teaching them to read critically, think creatively, write clearly and express themselves effectively. Their education provides ways of looking at the world as well as a body of knowledge on which to draw. All English majors take a common core of twelve credits and then specialize in one of four tracks: Literature, Writing and Rhetoric, Creative Writing, Linguistics. Through reading, discussing, and writing about significant texts, students enhance their abilities to understand and analyze fiction, poetry, drama, and nonfictional prose; at the same time, they gain insights into individual lives and cultures that enrich their own experiences. FIU English majors enjoy a variety of professional and educational careers including editing and publishing, teaching, technical writing, law, corporate and not-for-profit management, information technology and graduate study in English, Linguistics and other disciplines. Majoring in English prepares students for graduate work in English and for admission to law school; in addition, students can enter a careers where good writing and excellent critical thinking skills are required.
