Program Description
The Bachelors of Arts and Bachelors of Science programs prepare students for work and involvement in environmental professions and issues. The Bachelor of Arts degree provides students who are interested in the humanities and social sciences with a broad overview of environmental issues, and prepares students for future study in fields such as environmental administration and law. Although the B.A. degree emphasizes the political, social and economic aspects of environmental issues, basic principles of environmental science are introduced. Students are required to choose a subject specialty (e.g., energy policy) or an appropriate minor (e.g., economics or biology).
