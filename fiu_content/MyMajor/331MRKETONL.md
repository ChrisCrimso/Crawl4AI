The marketing major provides a solid understanding of business activities under the marketing umbrella-from the identification and selection of target markets, to the development, pricing, placement and promotion of goods and services, and the management of relationships among business partners and their customers. Students receive a broad foundation in marketing concepts and practices and opportunities to pursue greater understanding and skills in selected areas of the discipline including sales, advertising, distribution and logistics, and international marketing. Graduates are able to understand consumer behavior, calculate retail pricing on both cost and profit based approaches, interpret the language of marketing research, and analyze a company's marketing strategy in order to recognize appropriate and inappropriate marketing alternatives.
