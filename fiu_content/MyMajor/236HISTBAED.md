Program Description
History studies past human experience in all its imaginable aspects: economic, social, political, cultural, intellectual, scientific and technological. Relying on a variety of documents, historians develop interpretations of a wide range of the human experience, including scientific and technological breakthroughs, famines, the formation, evolution and conflicts of family groups, mass migrations, wars, cultural encounters, and revolutions. History students are trained to be critical readers, good writers, and astute analysts. These qualities and skills are fundamental for success in business activities, public and professional careers, teaching, and advanced studies. This degree-specific program combines the rigorous requirements of the History B.A. program with content-specific pedagogy to prepare students interested in teaching Social Studies at the secondary level. The History B.A. with Social Studies Education major offers a degree in the discipline with multiple field experiences in diverse classroom settings and culminates in a full-time teaching internship. Upon graduation from the program, students are endorsed for Full Teacher Certification by the State of Florida’s Department of Education.
Admission Requirements
1. Students entering FIU as Freshmen or as a Transfer Student with less than 60 credits:
You are considered a freshman when you have earned less than 13 college credits since your high school graduation. Credits earned in Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate programs do not affect your freshman status.
Students entering with fewer than 60 approved credits must meet the general FIU criteria. Click here for the details.
In addition, secondary education majors are limited access majors with specific requirements established by the State of Florida Department of Education. Students wishing to enroll in a teacher preparation program must maintain a 2.5 GPA. Additionally, students must take and pass all four sections of the General Knowledge Test (Mathematics, Reading Comprehension, English Language Skills, and Essay) within the first 60 credits. These requirements must be met before a student can be fully admitted into a teacher preparation program that results in endorsement for full teacher certification. Please see the Secondary Education Advisor for more details (305-348-2978).
2. Students transferring to FIU with 60 or more earned, approved credits:
Education majors resulting in endorsement for teacher certification have specific requirements for admission at the upper division level. In addition to the general FIU Transfer Admissions criteria for students with 60 credits or more, the following criteria must be met:
- Minimum 2.5 GPA (based on a 4.0 scale) in lower-division coursework
- Completed University Core Curriculum
- Completed major-specific lower division common pre-requisites
