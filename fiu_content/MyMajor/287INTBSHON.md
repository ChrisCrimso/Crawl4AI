Program Description
In today's business world, the globalization of markets and production is more evident than ever. Global trade is growing at unprecedented speed and is affecting all businesses, even those focused on the domestic market. To be successful, managers must be aware of the importance of regional trade agreements and supra-national organizations, and the effect of foreign exchange systems and the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange. Students who major in international business develop an understanding of these important issues along with knowledge of the strategies used by multinational corporations and how to manage in a cross-cultural environment.
