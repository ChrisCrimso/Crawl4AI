Campus:

Program Description
The French and Francophone major focuses on becoming fluent in the language, both spoken and written, and knowledgeable about the culture and literature of the French-speaking world. Our department also sponsors an optional Summer Study Abroad Program in France to enhance exposure to the language. French majors are fully prepared to enter graduate programs in French Literature and Linguistics, as well as teach at the high school level. The mastery of French can also lead to many opportunities in government, commerce or hospitality, either abroad or within Florida which is home to over 200 French companies. One of the official languages of Canada, US's largest trading partner, French is an ideal second major or minor for students in Business or International Relations.
