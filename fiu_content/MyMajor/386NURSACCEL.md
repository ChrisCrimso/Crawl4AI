Program Description
The Accelerated Option Bachelor of Science in Nursing (AO BSN) program is uniquely designed for those who hold a bachelor’s degree in another field. It is also available to foreign educated physicians who hold a Doctor of Medicine from an accredited foreign medical school and are seeking a career change. The AO BSN is comprised of three (3) semesters of full-time coursework, beginning with an intensive mini-semester of nursing fundamentals immediately prior to the start of the track. Students are admitted into the AO BSN track once a year in the fall semester and begin during the fall B session.
Admission Requirements
Minimum 3.00 GPA from a BA/BS degree in another discipline from a regionally accredited institution; FEP’s: Doctor of Medicine from an accredited foreign medical school with a minimum 2.00 GPA. Applicants must provide original transcripts from their medical school to Undergraduate Admissions to determine degree equivalency. A NACES evaluation can also be provided if already obtained (but is not required). Translations, preferably from a NACES organization, must be submitted if the transcripts are not in English. You can find all participating members at[https://www.naces.org](https://www.naces.org/). If an FEP has already obtained an RN license through another nursing program, the individual does not qualify for the AO BSN track.
