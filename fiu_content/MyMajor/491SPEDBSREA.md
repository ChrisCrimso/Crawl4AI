Program Description
The undergraduate Reading and ESOL Endorsements program utilizes a field-centered preparation model leading to approval for State of Florida Certification in Exceptional Student Education with ESOL and Reading Endorsements. The program is an initial teacher preparation program that will prepare teachers of students with disabilities in K-12 settings with coursework and field experiences that focus on the necessary skills to assess, plan, teach, and evaluate the education of students with high-incidence disabilities, including those who are ESOL. Students are prepared to teach learners with high-incidence disabilities from ages 5-22.
The Florida Education of Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) competencies are met throughout program coursework. The Reading Endorsement competencies are addressed and assessed in four program courses and with corresponding field experiences.
