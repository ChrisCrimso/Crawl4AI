Program Description
The Philosophy Major emphasizes effective and critical reading, writing, and speaking; and the study of philosophy deals with the interpretation of texts, the balanced exposition and examination of issues, the construction and appraisal of arguments and explanations, and the criticism of doctrines and things commonly taken for granted. The skills and training which one receives as a philosophy major or minor are valuable in many careers. The major serves as evidence to prospective employers or graduate schools that one is capable of creative and analytical thinking and proficient in research, reasoning, problem-solving, and verbal and written communication. Among the fields to which philosophy majors have entered are teaching at the pre-college level, government, law, medicine, business, journalism, and publishing.
