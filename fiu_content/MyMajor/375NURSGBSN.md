Program Description
The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is a limited access program (admitting 100 students each fall) for students who wish to become a registered nurse (RN) and obtain their BSN degree. Nursing is the fastest growing profession in the U.S. This program teaches students using our advanced STAR (Simulation Teaching and Research) Center, interdisciplinary simulation and clinical experiences. Students learn nursing science, nursing skills, cultural sensitivity, and the application of research to provide high-quality, evidence-based, compassionate nursing care to assist multi-generational, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual patients/clients and specific underserved populations to improve their health, restore health, to live with chronic care conditions, and to rehabilitate disabilities in the acute care and community settings.
