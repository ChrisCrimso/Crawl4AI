Program Description
The Special Education, Educational Foundations, and Policy Track focuses on exposing students to individuals with special needs. Students will learn about the specific cognitive, language, and social/emotional developmental needs for individuals with disabilities. Students will also learn about general and early education practices and curricula. Students will select cognates within the track that will provide strategic planning for advanced degrees in areas that serve individuals with special education, including Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA), policy, advocacy, law, business, health services, mental health and public administration. These areas of interests will assist students who want to gain knowledge in Special Education, Educational Foundations, and Policy for their advanced degrees and do not plan to be teachers. (NOTE: This track does not result in a teacher certification.)
