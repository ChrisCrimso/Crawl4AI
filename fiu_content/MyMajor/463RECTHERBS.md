Recreation Therapy,
BS
Arts, Sciences & Education
Campus:
Modesto Maidique Campus
Program Description
Recreational Therapy, also known as Therapeutic Recreation, is a health profession that uses recreation and leisure based interventions to improve the physical, social, cognitive, and emotional functioning of individuals with disabilities. It is a profession where you can enhance independent living skills and overall quality of life of people through leisure and recreation based treatment and activities.
The Florida International University Recreational Therapy Program provides a nationally recognized curriculum designed "To prepare competent entry-level recreational therapists in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains." Students are prepared to work in a variety of human service settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursing facilities, veterans’ services, community parks, recreation centers, mental health facilities, correctional facilities and private practice, among others. Students learn from faculty members who are all nationally certified and recreational therapists with many years of experience.
The BS/MS Combined Degree in Recreation and Sport Management: Recreational Therapy Track (RT 4+1) prepares students to be eligible for certification as a Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist (CTSR) and work as a recreational therapist after the bachelor’s degree and also be able to complete a master’s degree online in one year after the BS. Having a master’s degree in the field will allow students to be more competitive for RT jobs and likely offer more potential for upward mobility at an agency to become an administrator or manager in the future.
