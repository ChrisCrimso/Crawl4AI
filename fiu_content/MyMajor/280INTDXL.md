Program Description
As a Master of Interior Design student, you engage interior architecture in a refreshingly effective manner. Our graduates work in many different settings designing commercial interior architecture. They possess strong professional and content background, and are capable of thoughtful, creative design activities. The program is a comprehensive accredited professional degree program designed to involve students in advanced study of public interiors. Students participate in two years of interdisciplinary foundation undergraduate coursework followed by three years of graduate professional curriculum. A baccalaureate degree is not awarded at any point in the course of study. The unique full-time curriculum centers on the ten-studio sequence that provides students with firsthand experience of a wide range of interior design issues.
Admission Requirements
1. Students entering FIU as Freshmen
You are considered a freshman when you have earned less the 13 college credits since your high school graduation. Credits earned in Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs do not affect your freshman status.
The professional design majors are Selective Admissions programs. Students must meet the general FIU criteria for students entering with fewer than 60 approved credits, [Click here for the details](http://admissions.fiu.edu/apply/freshman/), and must also submit a portfolio for evaluation by the School of Architecture.
