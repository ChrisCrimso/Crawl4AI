# FIU Theatre
FIU Theatre is uniquely situated in a major global city distinguished by cultural diversity and a vibrant arts scene. Accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST), the department’s primary purpose is to immerse students in the practical work of theatre production while familiarizing them with world theatre history, criticism, literature, theory, and analysis.
We produce 4-5 plays a year, spanning genres, historical eras, and styles. All of our plays are performed, designed, and built by our talented students and faculty. The plays serve as the laboratories where our students put their learning into practice.
Only 125 majors are selected for our program. This gives our students many opportunities to work on productions and receive one-on-one mentorship from our quality faculty. FIU is the fourth largest university in the country, meaning our students get all of the perks of a large university while enjoying the luxury of a small program.
Our students travel to, and present work at, regional and national conferences like the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival (KCACTF) and the United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT), where they are consistently recognized for the quality of their work. Over the past 5 years, 39 students have received 54 awards, including 7 scholarships to attend the national Kennedy Center festival in Washington, DC.
Our home is The Wertheim, a professional theatre venue with a 200 seat proscenium theatre and a 90-120 seat black box theatre. It also has cutting-edge scene and costume shops, a design studio, and a light lab stocked with the latest technology. We also have classroom and performance spaces across campus, like our DM-150 Theatre where we perform some of our shows and present student-directed work.

### **Current**
Esther spends her days sewing luxury lingerie for women from every corner of New York, but as a Black woman in 1905, the life she yearns for is not so easily stitched together.
Lynn Nottage’s beautiful play is about passion, love, and the power of holding onto yourself when the world tries to pull you apart.
