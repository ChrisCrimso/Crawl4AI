# First Year Pathways
## Fall Direct
We designed the “Fall Direct” pathway to meet the needs of high-achieving FTIC students who intend to graduate from FIU in 48 months. This is the most selective of the admission pathways to FIU.
Fall 2024 Admitted Student Profile| 50% Lower| Middle| 50% Upper  
---|---|---|---  
SAT| 1250| 1310| 1380  
ACT| 26| 29| 31  
GPA| 4.10| 4.40| 4.70  
## Fall STEP for Engineering, STEM and Business
FIU will admit students who demonstrate a capacity to be successful in college-level coursework but are not yet calculus-ready or must complete College Algebra. Students admitted to this pathway will begin their career at FIU with less than full-time enrollment. 
This pathway has term limits until the spring term. The student will have outside-of-the-classroom activities to supplement traditional classroom instruction. 
## Early Fall Direct
To provide many incoming FTIC students with the best opportunity for success during the traditional fall semester, we admit selected students to our Early Fall Direct pathway, and they will register for summer and fall during their Advising & Registration Day.
Early Fall 2024 Admitted Student Profile| 50% Lower| Middle| 50% Upper  
---|---|---|---  
SAT| 1080| 1130| 1180  
ACT| 21| 23| 24  
GPA| 3.90| 4.20| 4.40  
## Early Fall STEP for Engineering, STEM and Business
We admit selected students to our Early Fall STEP Engineering, STEM, and Business pathway to provide incoming FTIC students with the best opportunity for success during the early fall semester. These students demonstrate a capacity to be successful in college-level coursework but require additional preparation for advanced concepts in math and science. Students begin this pathway in the summer term as part-time students; if they complete the summer successfully, they progress to the fall term as part-time.
This pathway has term limits until the spring term. The student will have outside-of-the-classroom activities to supplement traditional classroom instruction. 
## Early Fall STEP
We admit selected students to our Early Fall STEP pathway to provide incoming FTIC students with the best opportunity for success during the early fall semester. Students begin this pathway in the summer term as part-time students; if they complete the summer successfully, they progress to the fall term as part-time. 
## Top 10% Access to FIU
To provide many incoming FTIC students with the best opportunity for success during the traditional Early Fall semester, we admit selected students to our Early Fall STEP pathway who are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class and are graduating from a Florida high school. Applicants considered through this pathway must meet the minimum admission requirements set forth by the [Florida Board of Governors under regulation 6.002](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/6.002_Admission-of-Undergraduate-FTIC_09.08.23.pdf) and present a test score from the SAT, ACT, or CLT for admission.
## Golden Scholars
To provide many incoming FTIC students with the best opportunity for success during the traditional fall semester, we will offer some students an opportunity to participate in the Golden Scholars Summer Bridge Program. Student Access and Success will select these students based on supplemental information about their participation in a TRIO or CBO program designed to be a college-bound support program; participation in the national free/reduced lunch program; attendance at a Title 1 school; or students who are the first in their family to attend college. Interested students will be asked to complete a supplemental application. 
## Pathways for GED or Homeschooled Applicants
Under Florida Board of Governors regulation 6.002, FIU considers applicants who have completed high school through home education, GED, or non-traditional programs if they present credentials determined to be equivalent to a standard high school diploma in the State of Florida and a minimum SAT score of 1060 or ACT score of 21 or a CLT score of 67. Minimum scores do not guarantee admission.
## HS Diploma AA from FCS Pathway – Alternative Pathway
**High School Applicants earning an AA from a Florida State College or State University**
High school students participating in dual enrollment and other acceleration programs, and who are on track to earn an associate in arts (AA) degree**from a Florida College System or State University System institution** , and who do not meet the requirements of[Florida Board of Governors Regulation 6.004](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6.004-Transfer-Student-Admission_11_2022.pdf), may be considered for admission as either a freshman or potential AA transfer student. Applicants should complete the general admissions application and the[supplemental AA application](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=4210510 "Supplemental application for high school applicant earning AA degree"), in addition to the requirements outlined below.
Admission is contingent upon completing all additional requirements for admission:
  * Students selected for the FTIC option must meet the requirements in[Florida Board of Governors Regulation 6.002.](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/6_002FINAL_FTIC_03252020.pdf)
  * Students who would benefit from the AA admissions option have the choice to submit SAT, ACT or CLT scores.
  * Students who are admitted to this option must complete the AA degree and their high school diploma. Failure to complete either may result in their admission decision being rescinded.


Applicants who would benefit from this pathway will work closely with their school’s college counselor and FIU University Admissions. Those admitted will still participate in first-year programs, orientation, and residence life.
## Spring Direct
We designed the “Spring Direct” pathway to meet the needs of FTIC students who may benefit from taking 2-3 courses at the state college in the summer/fall before entering FIU. The recommended number of credit hours is 11. 
## Connect4Success
This pathway is designed for applicants attending a member of the State College System of Florida before attending FIU. Applicants will apply to FIU through the Connect4Success application, select a partner college (any member of the FSC in Florida), and apply to that college. During their two years at the state college, FIU will hold their application until they are ready to transition to FIU. Benefits include having an academic advisor at FIU, an FIU OneCard, and access to FIU academic and social events.
Our Decision Process
Admission to FIU is selective and is based on high school GPA, grades in academic core courses, course selection, college readiness in math, writing, and reading, and having a standardized test score. In some cases, FIU also considers class rank and special talents through auditions, portfolios, or tryouts.
Applicants who have submitted a complete application and all supporting materials by the required deadlines will receive an admissions decision. We employ a comprehensive process to evaluate your academic criteria. 
When we review an application, we consider the applicant’s probability of success based on what the applicant has accomplished in their academic history and through their opportunities and challenges. No one single factor determines an admission decision.
Once a decision is made you are notified through MyFIU, email, and letter. The decision to place the applicant in a pathway or start a specific term is based on academic success factors. We will only consider an appeal if it contains new and compelling information with supporting documentation.
SUS institutions have only recently adopted the CLT exam as an admissions requirement, and a concordance relationship is still being established. Once the university finalizes a concordance table, this website will be updated.
