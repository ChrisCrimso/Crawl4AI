## Student Life
At the bay, there are so many opportunities for students to explore away from the classroom. BBC has its own branches for [Student Government Association](https://www.facebook.com/FIUSGABBC/) and Student Programming Council, along with campus committees for the U-Wide Black Student Union and Homecoming Council, and so much more. These student-led organizations are the backbone of BBC student life and offer a hands-on lesson in diversity, leadership, and personal development.
Despite the small campus feel, there are a growing number of clubs and organizations that offer students the chance to get involved, make lifelong friends, network and sharpen personal and professional skills.
