##  Overview 
Technology has influenced every industry as digital advances proliferate the working world. The evolution of computers has accelerated to a place where before programs are incorporated, they’re already being reworked and improved. Because of this, computer science is a valuable field for most industries that rely on computing, digital information and database management as well as programming.
Understanding this merging, FIU’s online B.A. in Computer Science offers students the choice to marry the B.A. in Computer Science with another degree, such as digital media, business, economics and more. The program allows graduates to pursue careers in the field of computing, while it offers them the ability to have a more specialized focus outside of computer science.
The program provides strong skills in Computer Science, but unlike the B.S. in Computer Science, it is not as math and science-heavy like the B.S. in Computer Science.
**Take the next step.**
With FIU Online, you can learn anywhere, anytime. Our interactive technology enables you to watch lectures, get real-time feedback from your instructors and collaborate with classmates on projects. It's the convenient, flexible and affordable approach to a better future.
  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-computer-science.php)
The B.A. in Computer Science is for students who want more choice and flexibility with their coursework and are interested in obtaining computing skills to pursue careers in fields that use technology in a significant way such as in the health, science, medical or research fields.
Students of this program will gain skills needed to research technological solutions and create digital programming to offer new solutions. Graduates will be prepared to offer new approaches for computing technology to create greater efficiencies and ensure systems operate in intended manners.
**Career Opportunities**
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of computer and information research scientists is projected to grow 19 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Computer scientists are likely to enjoy excellent job prospects because many companies report difficulties finding these highly skilled workers.

![Maria Cristina Charters](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/_assets/faculty2/maria-cristy-charters.jpg) |  **Maria Cristina Charters** is an instructor for SCIS, Ms. Charters enjoys teaching the courses that start students off in their IT or CS major: COP 1360, COP 2250, COP 3804, and COP 3337. She is passionate about spreading Computer Science education to all children, starting in kindergarten, through elementary, middle, and high school. She also believes that all students at FIU should get a chance to learn how Computer Science impacts their lives, and to dabble in a little bit of coding in languages such as Python and tools like MIT App Inventor. That is why she helped develop a new online course, IDC 1360 – Computer Science for Everyone, which is designed for students who are non-CS and non-IT majors. She would like all students at FIU to consider taking IDC 1360. Prior to teaching at FIU, Ms. Charters had 2 other careers. Most recently, she was an educator and teacher-trainer within the Miami-Dade County Public School District. Her first career was as a Computer Programmer/Analyst for FPL, where she developed mainframe and client/server systems. She is an FIU alumni, and feels blessed to be able to work in SCIS as an Instructor, after having graduated from FIU with a degree in Computer Science many years ago.
