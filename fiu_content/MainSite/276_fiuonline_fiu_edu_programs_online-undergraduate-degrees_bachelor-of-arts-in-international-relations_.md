Do you have a passion for world issues?

The major's unique interdisciplinary curriculum includes courses across a broad range of social, political and economic disciplines to prepare you for an increasingly interdependent world. 
FIU's fully online BA in International Relations is designed to produce graduates who think critically, creatively and independently about important global issues.

  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-international-relations.php)
Complex economic, political and cultural issues transcend international boundaries. With a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations from FIU, you can gain a whole-world perspective on the choices and challenges shared among nations. The study of international relations requires the ability to research and analyze information, solve problems, and express oneself clearly in speech and writing—all highly desirable skills to employers. With globalization and the growing importance of cross-cultural understanding in business and government, graduates will be well-positioned for a wide variety of careers.
**Career Opportunities**
Many of our international relations graduates have gone on to excel in public service, including careers with local, state, and national governments, and with international and non-governmental organizations. Others have entered the private sector in fields as diverse as banking and finance, consulting, business, journalism, law, marketing, and higher education. In politics and government, a bachelor's degree in international relations can lead to positions as a policy analyst, legislative aide or foreign service officer. In the private sector, there are job opportunities in international business and commerce, helping companies navigate export restrictions, trade regulations, and managing teams across cultures and continents. In the public sector, work on humanitarian efforts can focus on economic development, fighting famine or eradicating disease.
