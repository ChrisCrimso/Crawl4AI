**Basic Research in Engineered Tissue Model Systems**![FIU Bioengineering Studies](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%20200%22%3E%3C/svg%3E) Basic Research in Engineered Tissue Model Systems research focuses on cell and engineered tissue mechanics with a particular focus on cardiovascular regenerative medicine. The goal is to understand and control the molecular and mechano-regulation of cellular phenotypes within tissues for therapeutic benefit. Research in this area includes the development of non-invasive strategies to restore normal tissue function and design and synthesis of living tissue replacements.
**Diagnostic Bioimaging and Sensor Systems** Research in this area includes developing non-destructive optical and mechanical technologies that can detect disease development and tissue injuries in vivo. These techniques can be either one-dimensional (i.e., point detection) or multi-dimensional (i.e., imaging). The potential medical applications for such techniques, once developed, are abundant. For example, they may be used intraoperatively to guide tumor resection and to monitor the progression of a novel therapy.
There is also a strong focus on Optical imaging which is based on the principles of near-infrared light propagation in scattering media (such as biological tissues) and the use of external fluorescent contrast agents to better differentiate normal and diseased tissues based on the differences in their optical properties. The research work requires an understanding of transport phenomena in biological systems, application of experimental skills towards instrument development, incorporation of optimization and mathematical tools towards image reconstructions, and development of biomedical aspects of engineering towards practical applications, such as cancer diagnostics, drug delivery, and in general, body imaging.
**Therapeutic and Reparative Neurotechnology** Research in Therapeutic and Reparative Neurotechnology focuses on biologically inspired technologies to interface with the nervous system to repair and promote recovery of lost function after trauma or disease. Research in this area includes behavioral studies, electrophysiology techniques, computational neuroscience, and machine learning methods to determine the mechanism of disease, create new research paradigms, and develop new treatments.
Research also spans both pre-clinical (i.e., animal) and clinical (i.e., human) neural engineering and neuropathophysiology, and includes investigations of motor and sensory function before, during, and after neuroprosthetic, pharmacological, and physical therapy-based interventions.
Current efforts focus on leveraging the differential effects of brainstem neuromodulatory centers on the spinal motor and sensory circuits to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying neurological impairments. Topics of particular interest within this area include:
  * **Pathologies** : stroke, spinal cord injury, whiplash-associated disorders, and chronic pain.
  * **Physiology** : neuromodulation (chemical and electrical), cortical and spinal reorganization, function and integrity of motor and sensory pathways post-injury, and activity-dependent neural plasticity.
  * **Techniques** : robotics/quantification of motor deficits, biophysical signal processing, recurrent neural-computer interfaces, neuropharmacology, physical therapy, electrical stimulation of the central nervous system, magnetic resonance imaging.


The Ph.D. program requires a total of 75 credit hours beyond the BS degree. These credits are comprised of a minimum of 27 hours of coursework and a minimum of 24 hours of dissertation. You’ll choose three courses from the Engineering Management core based on personal training requirements.
