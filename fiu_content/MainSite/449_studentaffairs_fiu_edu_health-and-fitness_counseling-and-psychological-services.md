Exciting shots of the FIU campus and its students demonstrating the university's vibrancy and diversity.
## Real experiences in and outside the classroom
College is a rich and multi-faceted adventure, shaped by experiences learned both in and outside the classroom. Participating in an intramural sport, writing for the student newspaper or serving as a cabinet member for [Student Government Association](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/student-government-association/index.html) can influence your interests, provide practical skills and experience, and enrich learning.
The Division of Student Affairs supports these experiences by engaging students outside of the classroom through [more than 50 departments](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/index.html). Let's explore and grow together.
