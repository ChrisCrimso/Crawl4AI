The Department of Art and Art History offers a **Bachelor of Arts in Art History** that is designed to introduce methodologies and subjects of Art History from throughout the world. In addition to traditional European and American subjects from ancient to modern times, we offer a strong emphasis on Latin American art from Pre-Columbian to the present. The BA in Art History provides professional education as preparation for careers as art professionals and for further graduate study. The BA compliments our BFA degree program in art and provides significant interaction between artists and historians.
