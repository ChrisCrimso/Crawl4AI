# Degrees
The Department of Landscape Architecture + Environmental and Urban Design focuses on developing the fundamental knowledge, skills, and abilities essential to the practice of landscape architecture, with a special emphasis on tropical and subtropical landscapes. Alongside this focus, our program provides a comprehensive education that includes other geographical regions. Our goal is to educate individuals who can lead and serve their communities by enhancing the quality of life through meaningful, equitable, aesthetic, and sustainable design of the physical environment.

### **Degree**
  * Landscape Architecture
  * Urban Design


### **Masters**
  * [MLA](https://catalog.fiu.edu/programs/LAND:MLA)
  * [Accelerated MLA](https://catalog.fiu.edu/programs/LANDXL:MLA)
  * [MAUD](https://catalog.fiu.edu/programs/URBD:MA)


## **Accreditation**
The professional Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) degree is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB). LAAB develops standards to evaluate landscape architecture programs and advances the quality of education in landscape architecture programs. LAAB comprises landscape architecture practitioners and academics, and includes representatives from landscape architecture collateral organizations such as the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB), and the Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture (CELA). LAAB accreditation standards and procedures are available online at [www.asla.org/accreditationlaab.aspx](http://www.asla.org/accreditationlaab.aspx).
## **Undergraduate**
The accelerated Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) program provides a seamless course of study leading from undergraduate freshman year to the conferral of the Professional Master of Landscape Architecture degree. This 5-year track is for students wishing to enter the program directly from high school. During the first two years, landscape architecture students complete a Pre-Graduate Foundation in Design curriculum composed of professional core, and of general education course work. Successful students from Pre-Graduate Foundations in Design then matriculate into the final three years of the Accelerated Master of Landscape Architecture program.
## **Graduate**
The Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) provides professional degree tracks within a rigorous academic framework intended for individuals with or without pre-professional degrees in landscape architecture. The MLA is structured into two tracks.
The **Three-Year Track (MLA3)** is a first professional Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) for persons who hold an undergraduate degree in a field other than landscape architecture, and intend to become landscape architecture practitioners. Applicants to the program need to check with the College Advising Center to obtain prerequisite course information.
The **Two-Year Track (MLA2)** is a first professional degree for individuals with an undergraduate degree in landscape architecture or architecture from an accredited program, or with a pre-professional undergraduate degree landscape architecture or architecture. Admission to the two-year track is contingent upon review of applicant’s portfolio and transcripts by department faculty to determine that applicants have demonstrated the knowledge and skills equivalent to students who have completed the first year of the three-year track (MLA3).
## **Post-Professional**
Master of Arts in Urban Design (MAUD) – The [Master of Arts in Urban Design](https://carta.fiu.edu/landscape/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/Master-of-Arts-in-Urban-Design_TRACK.pdf) is a 36- credit graduate degree program that enables students to pursue interdisciplinary studies in advanced environmental urban design. As an environmental design based program, the MAUD combines collaborative design instruction, applied research, and knowledge of urban theory, planning, and economics. This graduate degree is for individuals with a Bachelor or Master of Architecture, a Bachelor or Master of Landscape Architecture, a Bachelor or Master of Interior Architecture, a Bachelor or Master of Science or Arts, a Bachelor or Master of Public Administration. One year of full-time study in residency is normally required. Study abroad options are also available. Satisfactory completion of 36 credits in the following course of study is required.
## **Certificate Program**
The Certificate in Landscape Architecture offers students the ability to explore the design, planning, and management of regional landscapes. This program is developed to serve graduate students who would like to expand their academic experience with this area of specialized study. Focused on landscape design and development, the certificate seeks to extend students’ skills, knowledge, and critical thinking about the design, making, and managing of existing and built landscape environments. Students who wish to earn the Certificate in Landscape Architecture should contact the Advising Center at the College of Communication, Architecture + The Arts in advance of pursuing this course of study.
