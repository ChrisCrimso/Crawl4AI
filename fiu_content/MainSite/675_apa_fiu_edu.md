## Areas of Oversight
The FIU Office of Academic Planning and Accountability (APA) provides support to all administrative units and academic programs through integrated processes that include quality improvement, data collection, and guidance in assessment practices.
APA includes institutional effectiveness, academic planning, and program review. The unified focus of these efforts will be the foundation for a sustainable framework that promotes best practices in assessment, integrating this information for improved decision-making across the university. In addition, this new integrated approach works in tandem with the university's accreditation cycle. Consistent with the national trend in higher education, this office will also be responsible for the implementation of academic strategic plans.
In addition, this office oversees all matters concerning institutional accreditation, program accreditation, academic program approval and review, continuing education, and educational affiliations.
