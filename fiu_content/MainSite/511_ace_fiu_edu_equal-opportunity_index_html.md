# Equal Opportunity
![](https://ace.fiu.edu/equal-opportunity/fiu-students-sasc.jpg)
The Office of Equal Opportunity (EO) is responsible for continuously assessing university resources and the infrastructure that ensures an atmosphere free from discrimination, harassment, and that is in compliance with federal and state laws governing equal opportunity. As a federal contractor, EO is included in every step of the employee life cycle including job postings and posting waivers, review search and screen committees, compensation reviews, promotions, reclassifications, and applicable trainings to foster commitment and awareness of federal and state laws and University regulations. By adhering to these principles, our University meets legal requirements and strives to cultivate a campus culture that values respect, fairness, and the well-being of all its students, faculty, and staff. This commitment extends beyond mere compliance and enables a vibrant and supportive academic community that attracts top talent and supports mechanisms to retain such talent.

# OFCCP
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is a government agency under the U.S. Department of Labor responsible for ensuring that federal contractors and subcontractors provide equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees, prohibiting discrimination based on protected categories such as race, sex, disability, and veteran status. The OFCCP enforces requirements and laws impacting veterans and persons with disabilities, protecting against discrimination by companies doing business with the federal government, and aiming to create a fair and equitable hiring process for all Americans accessing employment opportunities funded by federal dollars.
