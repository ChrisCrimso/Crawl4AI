# Communication Sciences & Disorders
The ultimate reward for a speech-language pathologist is to break down the physical and cognitive barriers of communication.
The **Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology (MS-SLP)** at FIU prepares future practitioners to apply evidence-based practice, technology, and real-world experience with cultural humility.
Bilingual competency is critical as the multilingual population in our society continues to grow. **FIU’s Department of Communication Sciences & Disorders** is committed to preparing clinicians to assess and treat individuals who are culturally and linguistically different, enhance patient care, and engage in research that reflects the evolving skills needed in our profession. That is why our graduates excel and one of the many reasons our master’s degree stands out above the rest.
As one of the six departments of the **Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences**, FIU Communication Sciences & Disorders promotes effective interprofessional collaboration across fields, advanced research in healthcare delivery and evidence-based practice, as well as significant engagement with communities and partners around the world.
