Global trade is growing at unprecedented speed and is affecting all businesses, even those focused on the domestic market. A degree in international business will help you zero in on the steps to success and provide you with the skills needed to take advantage of emerging opportunities. You'll learn the necessary background on global trade and winning strategies used by multi-national corporations as they deal with cross-border political, legal, economic, social and financial issues.
Global growth is shifting to emerging markets, with dramatically different economic, political and social systems. Estimates show that 70 percent of world growth over the next few years will come from emerging markets, with China and India accounting for 40 percent of that growth. Professionals with international business and multicultural knowledge will be in high demand. Job prospects are best for those with a broad-based understanding of the new challenges that international companies face, including the growing impact of social media on business communication across borders and nations.
As U.S. organizations expand their business abroad, many will hire management analysts to help them for the right strategy for entering the foreign market.
