##  Overview 
In order to know where you are going, you need to know where you’ve been. This basic tenet is a foundational concept for Florida International University’s online BA in History students. Our program is forward-thinking, current and shapes graduates into leaders of tomorrow.
Globalization is a reality in today’s world. With emerging markets, evolving political states, and cultural conflicts, a bachelor’s degree in history will prepare you with a well-rounded regional view of the world’s most dynamic areas. Understand the complex interactions of the world’s cultures and develop the analytic skills needed to understand and change the world.
Students will gain critical skills for research, communication and investigative work as they learn about past societies and correlate these lessons to modern issues. Students will discover the causes and impacts of scientific and technological breakthroughs; environmental events; the formation, evolution and conflicts of family groups; mass migrations; wars, cultural encounters; and revolutions on regions across the world and from the ancient world to the present. The program covers art, religion, linguistic differences, and historical texts as well as philosophical thought on the cross sections of our shared human experience through time.
  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-history.php)
History students are trained to be critical readers, good writers, and astute analysts. They know how to find and identify relevant information, read and analyze large quantities quickly, notice patterns and trends, and articulate their finding clearly in writing and orally. These qualities are valued in almost every field.
History students have a strong presence in fields like education, museums, and libraries, but the possibilities are much broader. History majors excel in fields like business, law, and government; medicine, public health, and social work; journalism and communications. Our graduates are well-equipped for graduate study and dominate programs in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and education. They are also some of the best candidates for law schools.
