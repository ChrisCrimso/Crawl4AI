The McNair Scholars Program is a [federally-funded TRIO access program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/triomcnair/index.html), designed to prepare students from low-income, first-generation, and traditionally under-represented groups for graduate education as defined by the U.S. Department of Education. McNair Scholars participate in courses, seminars, and workshops on topics related to graduate school preparation, complete a paid research experience under the guidance of a faculty mentor, and have the opportunity to present their research at local, regional, or national conferences. The McNair program staff works closely with students as they complete their undergraduate requirements and graduate school applications.

## Dr. Ronald Erwin McNair
Physicist and Astronaut Ronald Erwin McNair Graduated from Carver High School, Lake City, South Carolina, in 1967; received a bachelor of science degree in Physics from North Carolina A&T State University in 1971 and a Doctor of Philosophy in Physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976; presented an honorary doctorate of Laws from North Carolina A&T State University in 1978, an honorary doctorate of Science from Morris College in 1980, and an honorary doctorate of science from the University of South Carolina in 1984.
**He was America’s second black astronaut and one of seven crew members killed in the space shuttle Challenger explosion on January 28, 1986. The flight would have been his second voyage in space.**
Dr. McNair’s legacy continues to be preserved through the McNair program. To commemorate his lifetime of accomplishments, the U.S. Department of Education, with funding from Congress, established the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program to encourage minority and low-income, first-generation college students to enroll in graduate studies and acquire a doctorate degree. The FIU McNair program is dedicated to assisting students in successfully completing their undergraduate degrees, teaching them leadership/ research skills, and preparing for success in graduate school programs.
