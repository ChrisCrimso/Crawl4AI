## Masters in International Studies
The MA program is designed to prepare students for careers in government, the private sector, or international agencies, or for doctoral studies.
The College of Arts and Sciences offers certificate programs in African-New World Studies, Asian Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Transnational and Regional Studies, among other. The graduate program encourages its MA students to pursue regional certification in conjunction with their work in the MA program.
The following is a brief summary of program requirements. For more information, see the [ IR Graduate Program Handbook](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/ir-grad-handbook-as-of-oct-2024.pdf)
  * [Admission Requirements](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-1)
### Admission Requirements
To be considered for admission to the MA program, applicants must have a GPA of 3.0 in upper-level work, or its equivalent, from a recognized institution of higher education. International graduate student applicants whose native language is not English are required to submit a score for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). A total score of 80 on the iBT TOEFL or 6.5 overall on the IELTS is required. Admissions requirements are minimums and even if the minimums are met, admission is not assured.
  * [Degree Requirements](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-2)
### Degree Requirements
The MA program requires a minimum of 36 semester hours of credit at the graduate level. Undergraduate courses taken to satisfy prerequisites for graduate courses will not count toward the 36 hour minimum requirement. The Graduate Advisory Committee may approve the transfer of a maximum of six graduate credits earned at another recognized institution of higher education.
  * [Core Sequence (12 credits)](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-3)
### Core Sequence (12 credits)
All MA students must complete a core sequence of four courses (12 credits).
These courses are:
    * INR 6706 Political Economy of International Relations
    * INR 5609 Contemporary Dynamics of International Relations
    * INR 5615 Research Design in International Relations
    * INR 5017 Approaches to Area Studies
  * [Major Field (12 credits)](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-4)
### Major Field (12 credits)
MA students also must select a major field of study in (1) Global Institutions and Issues, or (2) Foreign Policy and Securities Studies, by taking four courses (12 credits) from an extensive list of approved courses in the social sciences. Students must take at least two courses offered by the Department of International Relations to satisfy the field requirement. 
  * [Electives (6 credits)](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-5)
### Electives (6 credits)
To satisfy the program’s elective requirement, students must take two additional courses (6 credits) from the field lists. Students wishing to elect other graduate-level courses offered by the University may do so with permission of the Graduate Director.
  * [Thesis and Alternatives (6 credits)](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1021D-6)
### Thesis and Alternatives (6 credits)
To complete degree requirements, MA students have the option of (a) writing a thesis or (b) taking a comprehensive examination. Before electing any of these options, students must demonstrate competence in the use of a foreign language other than English.
Any student electing (a) to write a thesis will normally take 6 credit hours of thesis supervision and prepare a thesis proposal subject to the approval of three members of the University graduate faculty. A graduate faculty member of the Department of International Relations must chair any thesis committee thus constituted. No thesis may be approved until the writer has defended it in a public examination. Any student electing (b) to take a comprehensive examination must have 6 semester hours of course work in preparation for the exam. One half of the comprehensive examination will cover the core sequence of courses, and the other half will cover the student’s major field.


## PhD in International Relations
The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for careers as scholars and teachers. It provides students with a solid theoretical foundation while allowing individual latitude for rigorous research on a wide range of subjects. Students work closely with dedicated, internationally recognized scholars.
The following is a brief summary of program requirements. For more information, see the [PIR Graduate Catalog](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/graduate-politics-and-international-relations-1.pdf)
  * [Admission Requirements](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1047A-1)
### Admission Requirements
To be considered for admission to the Ph.D. program, all applicants must have a bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, from a recognized institution of higher education, or have received a bachelor’s degree before they matriculate in the program.
Applicants should have a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.2, or its equivalent, a minimum grade point average of 3.5 for all combined graduate work. International graduate student applicants whose native language is not English are required to submit a score for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). A total score of 90 on the iBT TOEFL (equivalent to 575 on the paper-based version of the Test of English as a Foreign Language) or 6.5 overall on the IELTS is required.
Applications will be reviewed only in the spring term for fall admission. Students who wish to be considered for graduate assistantships must submit an application by January 15 in the year in which they wish to begin their studies.
  * [Degree Requirements](https://pir.fiu.edu/graduate/international-relations-degrees/#panel-N1047A-2)
### Degree Requirements
The Ph.D. requires a minimum of 75 semester hours of credit at the graduate level.
Undergraduate courses taken to satisfy prerequisites for graduate courses will not count toward the 75 hour minimum requirement. Students earning an M.A. degree within the last five years may count 36 credits toward the 75 hour minimum requirement. The Graduate Advisory Committee may approve the transfer of a maximum of 12 graduate credits earned in a non-degree capacity at FIU.
Ph.D. students who have satisfied all other requirements for the M.A. apart from the exit requirement (i.e. all coursework and the foreign language competency) are eligible to receive an M.A. degree. Passing the doctoral comprehensive examinations serves as equivalent to the M.A. comprehensive examination. Ph.D. students who have satisfied their requirements should consult with the Graduate Program Director about the necessary paperwork and procedures to receive the M.A. degree in the course of their Ph.D. studies.
