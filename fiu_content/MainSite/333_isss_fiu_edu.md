## International Student Orientation
All students at FIU in F-1 or J-1 student status are required to attend a MANDATORY New International Student Orientation conducted by ISSS. This is different from other academic, departmental, or university-wide orientations, and it will cover information specific to international students regarding federal immigration regulations that you MUST be aware of. These sessions are offered at both the Biscayne Bay Campus and the Modesto A. Maidique Campus every semester.
[View upcoming orientation dates](https://isss.fiu.edu/international-students/new-f-1-students/international-student-sessions/index.html)
