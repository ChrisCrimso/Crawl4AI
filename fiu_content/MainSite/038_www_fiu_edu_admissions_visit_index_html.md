## Come See FIU in Person
Find out if FIU is the right fit for you. This student-led walking tour of our campuses features views of the Green and Hubert Libraries, our student center, dining facilities and more. Tour capacities are limited, and advanced registration is required. 
Florida weather can be warm with occasional rain showers. To ensure a comfortable experience for our guests, we'll adjust our tours to explore shaded or covered areas, protecting everyone from both sun and rain. Please wear comfortable clothing and shoes, sunscreen, or rain gear as needed. 
Campus Tours have limited availability, so be sure to secure your spot early. If the date and time you're looking for aren't available online, it means the tours are already booked for that day. Please consider selecting an alternate date and time.
Please note that campus tours are not offered during the holidays when the university is closed. 
**Summer 2025 Holidays:** May 26 &_July 4_
 _* There will be no campus tours at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus during the weeks of April 28–May 2 and May 26–May 30._

### MMC Tour Parking
When you arrive to the FIU Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC), located at 11200 SW 8 Street, Miami, FL 33199, we kindly ask that you report to the Student Academic Success Center (SASC). The closest entrance to SASC is 107th Avenue and 16th Street. Once you arrive to campus through this entrance and see the red sculpture at the roundabout, you will want to make a right and go towards the building that says “Welcome to FIU.” If you are using GPS, we suggest inputting “FIU Lot 3” as your destination. The FIU Parking Lot 3 is directly South of the SASC building and has paid metered parking available. Be sure to park in the parking stall labeled “Metered” and register your vehicle via the QR code signs in the parking lot. You can reference the FIU MMC campus map that features the tour starting point, SASC, and Parking Lot 3. Once you enter the SASC Building main lobby, look for the “Campus Tours” check-in counter.
