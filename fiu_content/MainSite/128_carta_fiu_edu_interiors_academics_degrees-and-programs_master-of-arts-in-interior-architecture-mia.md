# Master of Arts in Interior Architecture
# Health Care Design Track
Design effects health directly or indirectly. While health factors cannot be based on environment alone, recent research shows the impact of design on health and wellbeing, including stress reduction, cognitive performance, and emotion, mood and preference (The Drive Toward Healthier Buildings, 2016). The National Prevention Strategy proposed by CDC recognizes that good health comes not just from receiving quality medical care but from stopping disease before it starts. It helps move the nation away from a health care system focused on sickness and disease to one focused on wellness and prevention. In this context, evidence-based design for the access and sustenance of healthy spaces is not only vital, but inevitable. In today’s ever-changing world of healthcare, thinking of health as pervasive, rather than episodic is critical.
The Master of Arts (Health Care Design Track) is a post-professional degree (36 credits) to enhance professional credentials with specialized healthcare design expertise. Although grounded in design, the program provides an opportunity for students to create ‘what-if’ scenarios in healthcare design that might not be currently addressed in the industry, and to challenge conventional models of healthcare while engaging in Miami’s urban community. The program facilitates designers to engage with other stakeholders such as nursing, public health, health management, physical therapy among others.
For more information about the program contact Newton D’souza (ndsouza@fiu.edu). Applications are open until May 31st. To apply visit the following link (add a link to admissions) or talk to Mayra Ortega (maortega@fiu.edu)
_Degree requirements:_
Individuals with an undergraduate degree in Interior Design or Interior Architecture or Architecture are eligible for admission to the program provided University requirements are met. This 36 credit hour degree prepares students who wish to conduct research, teach and undertake advanced studies in specific areas. The course of study offers specialized study in one of our tracks. Shared among tracks is the 9 credit core and then each track has its specialized courses and electives. One year of full-time study in residency is normally required. However, a part-time study option is available subject to the review and approval of the Program. Satisfactory completion of 36 credits in the following course of study is required.
