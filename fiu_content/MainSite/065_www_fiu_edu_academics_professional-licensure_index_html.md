# Professional Licensure or Certification
The FIU programs listed below provide preparation to practice in fields in which state regulated professional licensure or certification may be available. All programs at FIU that prepare students to obtain licensure or certification meet the licensing requirements in the state of Florida. Requirements for state licensure or certification can vary by state. At this time, FIU cannot determine if these programs meet the licensing requirements in every state. If you have an interest in pursuing licensure or certification outside the state of Florida, we highly recommend that you contact the appropriate state licensing agency in your state or the state where you intend to work to seek the most up-to-date information about state licensure requirements before beginning the program.
