MFA – Master of Fine Arts in Visual Arts[crodri](https://carta.fiu.edu/arts/author/crodri/ "Posts by crodri")2025-03-12T18:32:16+00:00
# **MFA**
# **Master of Fine Arts in Visual Arts**
The **MFA in Visual Arts** at Florida International University is a stimulating and supportive environment in which individuals grow and expand as artists through a program that inextricably weaves its students’ experience into the fertile landscape of Miami. The 4th largest urban area in the country, Miami is home to prized international art fairs, prominent private collections, world class museums, and rich cultural dialogues. The city and surrounding area are one of the nation’s most significant and thriving arts communities.
The FIU MFA curriculum fosters rigorous critical engagement with contemporary and historical cultural art forms generating ongoing conversations through studio-based practices and discussions about what we make, how we make it, and why. We are a trans disciplinary, transnational program that challenges artists to develop a critical body of work through experimentation, research, and exploration. The program facilitates connections to the highest levels of contemporary art and design discourse. Ultimately, faculty guide artists in their pursuit of a sustained and successful career in the arts that will shape the future of visual culture.
