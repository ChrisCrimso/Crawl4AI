With over 58,000 students and a first year student acceptance rate of 50%, FIU admissions is considered selective. The admissions committee looks for applicants who are academically prepared, have challenged themselves with advanced courses, are active in their community or are motivated by a specific goal or passion. We strive to prepare applicants for a college education to open doors to more future Panthers every year.
## First Year Requirements
![](https://admissions.fiu.edu/_assets/images/admission-standards/freshman.jpg)
### Get Accepted to FIU
First year students are accepted to FIU based on a pathway designed to fit their academic history and goals. Admission decisions are made on a space-available basis â€“ if one pathway fills up, you may be accepted to the next. See if you qualify for FIU and which pathway fits you.
[First Year Pathways](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/freshman-pathways/index.html)
  * [Test Scores](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N103E6-1)
SAT, ACT and/or CLT scores are required for first time in college applicants. They are one factor used in the admissions decision as outlined in the Florida Board of Governors regulation [6.002](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/6.002FTICAdmissionsTechnicalchange2018_08_17.pdf). For more information see [First Year Pathways.](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/freshman-pathways/index.html)
  * [GPA](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N103E6-2)
FIU recalculates GPA based on your courses taken. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Dual Enrollment, AICE and Honors courses are all taken into consideration in your FIU weighted GPA. FIU weighted GPA is used for [Scholarships](https://admissions.fiu.edu/cost-and-aid/scholarships/index.html) as well.
  * [High School Courses](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N103E6-3)
This is the high school course load required for applying first year students. Taking courses beyond these minimum requirements can improve your chances of acceptance.
    * 4 credits of English
    * 4 credits of mathematics (at or above algebra I or higher)
    * 3 credits of natural science (two must have included substantial lab requirements)
    * 3 credits of social science (includes anthropology, history, civics, political science, economics, sociology, psychology and/or geography)
    * 2 credits second language
    * 2 credits in additional academic electives
  * [First Year Program Requirements](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N103E6-4)
Some degree programs, such as architecture and nursing, have higher minimum admissions requirements than others and may require additional information or exams along with your application. [Search degrees](https://www.fiu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs/index.html) to find specific admissions requirements of your desired degree.


In response to the [Chancellor of the Florida Board of Governors Emergency Order 2024-E0-01,](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BOG-EO-24-01.pdf) Florida International University, is working to remove barriers for those students seeking to transfer to a Florida university because of a well-founded fear of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or violence at an out-of-state, degree-granting, accredited institution, within the United States. To ensure adherence to the Order, if you are an applicant intending to undertake academic studies within FIU, please complete the online form [here](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=4438092) and one of our Admission staff will contact you regarding next steps.
## Transfer Requirements
![](https://admissions.fiu.edu/_assets/images/admission-standards/transfer.jpg)
### Florida Public or Community College Transfers
Students transferring with an associate in arts (AA) automatically qualify for admission to the university (with the exception of [Specialized Admissions Programs](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/)) through the Florida 2+2 Partnership. These students enter FIU as juniors having satisfied the university's general education requirements.
  * [Transfer Program Requirements](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N10820-1)
Transfers who are starting their third year of college (or are near earning 60 credits) should have a chosen degree. If you are entering FIU with your associate's degree, you must apply to the college or program of your choice in addition to university application. Some degree programs, such as architecture and nursing, have higher minimum admissions requirements than others and may require additional information or exams along with your application. See [Specialized Admissions Programs](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/) for requirements or [search degrees](https://www.fiu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs/).
  * [Credit Requirements](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/index.html#panel-N10820-2)
Students transferring without an associate's degree or with **fewer than 60 credits** are required to submit their SAT or ACT scores and transcripts from any schools they have attended (both high school and college). Transfer studentsâ€™ test scores must meet minimum test scores to qualify for admission.
Students with **30-59 credits** do not have to submit a high school transcript or test scores as long as they have:
    * Completed ENC 1101 or the equivalent with a â€˜Câ€™ or better
    * Completed college-level math with a â€˜Câ€™ or better
    * At least a 2.0 transfer GPA
    * Good academic standing at their last institution
Specialized Admission programs may have additional requirements. Please visit [transfer.fiu.edu](https://transfer.fiu.edu/) for the transfer equivalency database and transfer guides.

## Graduate Requirements
FIU admits over 6,000 graduate students every year. Admissions requirements vary by program. As a result, additional criteria may be used during the review process. Samples may include: entrance exams, resumes or portfolios, essays, letters of recommendation, etc. Search for your program to verify what you will need.
