## View Unofficial Transcript
Your unofficial transcript is a complete summary of your student academic record. You can review your degree program status and grades to ensure they are accurately posted. We highly recommend doing so before submitting an order for an official transcript.
Please note that FIU accounts (email, OneDrive, MyFIU, etc.) only remain active for two years after graduation or your last term of active enrollment. After the two-year period, you will no longer be able to access an unofficial transcript and an official transcript must be ordered. For instructions on requesting official transcripts, please refer to the official transcript request guidelines for alumni or former students. For more information about your student account and email, please visit [go.fiu.edu/emailpolicy](https://fiu.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=504c183a1b417558c16e639dee4bcb71).
_**Important Information**_
  * ** _Unofficial transcripts are only available to current students and students who still have access to MyFIU. FIU accounts (email, OneDrive, MyFIU, etc.) only remain active for two years after graduation or your last term of active enrollment. If you are unable to log in to your MYFIU account directly, you must request an official transcript through[Parchment](https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/34934/institution)._**
  * **_The Office of the Registrar cannot provide a student with a copy of their unofficial transcript; currently, unofficial transcripts are only available through self-service at MYFIU._**
  * **_Unofficial transcripts cannot replace an official transcript in instances that specifically ask for an official transcript (admission to another institution, application for employment...etc)._**
  * **_Unofficial transcripts are clearly marked "unofficial" and are not digitally certified._**


To view your unofficial transcript:
  1. Log into the MyFIU.
  2. Select 'Academic Records,' then 'Transcripts'.
  3. Choose 'View Unofficial Transcript' from the dropdown.
  4. Choose the 'Report Type' for the transcript and follow on-screen instructions.


## Order Official Transcripts
FIU has contracted with Parchment to provide transcript ordering, printing, and delivery services. Order an official transcript or view your unofficial transcript on MyFIU.
**ATTENTION:** If you are currently enrolled and just completed your course(s), or recently graduated, please verify through my.fiu.edu that your grades/degree(s) are posted and reflect accurately BEFORE ordering transcripts. If your grades are not on my.fiu.edu, please contact your instructor. **If you submit your order prior to grades/degree(s) being posted, your transcript cannot be canceled, deleted, or refunded. You will need to order and pay for another transcript once your grades/degree(s) are posted**.
The unofficial transcript reflects the same information as the official transcript, and students are encouraged to verify that their records are complete before placing an order.
### **Current Students**
  1. Log into the [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/).
  2. Select 'Academic Records,' then 'Transcripts.'
  3. Choose 'Request Official Transcript' from the dropdown.
  4. You will be directed to the FIU Parchment site to order your transcript. Prices and instructions are listed on the site.


### **Alumni and Former Students Instructions**
  1. Click on the Parchment page to get started. You must first create a Parchment account if you do not already have one:  _[Parchment Request](https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/33710/institution)_
  2. Create your Learner Account by entering your personal email that you check regularly. You will need this email for verification and future updates to your account. Fill in your personal and contact information. Choose a strong password for your Parchment account.
  3. Verify your email. Check your inbox for a verification email from Parchment. Click the link in the email to confirm your email address.
  4. You should now be able to log in to your Parchment account to request your transcript(s).
  5. You will be prompted for additional information, such as details about when you attended the institution, your Panther ID (if you have it), and the last four digits of your Social Security Number (SSN). Make sure your name matches what was on your records when you attended FIU.
  6. Follow any other instructions or prompts to request your transcript(s).


## **Parchment Customer Service**
If you need help with your transcript order, the [Parchment Support Team](https://www.parchment.com/chat-support/) is available Monday through Friday from 8am - 8pm EST. You may use the following link to check on the status of your order:

## **Waiver of Transcript Fee for Active Duty Military, Honorably Discharged Veterans, and/or Spouse and Dependents**
In accordance with [F.S. 1009.26 (17a)](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2020/1009.26), FIU students who are active-duty military, honorably discharged veterans of the United States Armed Forces, or spouses and/or dependents are eligible for a transcript fee waiver. The waiver will cover the $10 transcript cost. Additional services such as tracking and express mail are NOT covered by the waiver. To use any tracking or express service, the student must provide the appropriate pre-paid envelope or paperwork to the Office of the Registrar in advance of sending the transcript(s).
You must be confirmed as a student, dependent and/or spouse who meets the criteria above by the FIU Veteran and Military Affairs Office (VMA). If you have not been verified by the FIU VMA office, please contact them via email, veterans@fiu.edu, prior to requesting your transcripts.
If you meet the criteria above and have already provided documentation to the FIU VMA Office, please complete the electronic [Active Duty, Veterans, Spouses, and Dependents Transcript Request Form](https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5b705ffe-1532-4f38-b767-efeddefd182d&env=na3&acct=a21103ad-fbc4-4465-b27e-448e946576f9&v=2) to request your official transcripts. Once you submit the request, the form is automatically sent to transcripts@fiu.edu for processing.

Our office provides the notarization needed for the apostille process; however we do not provide the apostille certification on these documents. Please visit the [Procedure for Apostille Certification](https://notaries.dos.state.fl.us/notproc7.html) for more information. Please email notary@fiu.edu to initiate a notary request. Please note that only hard copy transcripts will be notarized.
