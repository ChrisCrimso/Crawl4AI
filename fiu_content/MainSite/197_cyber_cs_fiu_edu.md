###  About CIERTA
CIERTA serves as the technical hub for cybersecurity related interdisciplinary research, innovation and education within Florida International University (FIU). As cyberspace became vital for critical infrastructures and business operations, it is increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyber-attacks. There is a significant need for collaborative efforts between the academia, government and private sector to address these threats through research, partnership and education in cybersecurity. CIERTA aims to become a cybersecurity research and innovation hub in South Florida to address these needs.
####  Mission/Vision
CIERTA’s mission is to advance education, forward-thinking, and innovative research in cybersecurity, privacy, and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) by fostering collaboration among faculty from all disciplines to support interdisciplinary research across FIU that is integrated into our curricula.
CIERTA envisions becoming both a focal point for cybersecurity curriculum and practice, and a leading cybersecurity and trustworthy AI research hub and a solution center in South Florida, using its world-class faculty and cutting-edge research to support the evolving needs of industry, students, and government partners.
####  Strategic Objectives
1. Establish robust research infrastructure that supports FIU’s ability to capture large collaborative grants, ensuring sustainable and well-funded research activities through strategic partnerships with industry and government. 2. Strengthen FIU’s national and international brand and reputation in the areas of cybersecurity, privacy, and trustworthy AI. 3. Provide hands-on research and experiential learning opportunities to support existing and attract new undergraduate and graduate students. 4. Promote technology transfer, entrepreneurship, and community engagement to become an innovation and solution center in South Florida. 5. Establish mechanisms that can support university-wide interdisciplinary collaborations (e.g., joint research projects, research workshops, space-sharing, and inter-departmental/college student, and faculty exchanges, etc.). 6. Provide program guidance and oversight.
