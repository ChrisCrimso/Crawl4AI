# Department of Biological Sciences
We are conducting research to address the greatest challenges of our time and train the next generation of biologists. We are breaking new ground in the field — from coral reefs in the Florida Keys to mangroves in the Everglades to tropical rainforests around the world — as well as in our cutting-edge laboratories, providing training and research opportunities in a variety of disciplines.
