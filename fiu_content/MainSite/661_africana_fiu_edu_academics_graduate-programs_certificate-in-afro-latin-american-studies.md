# Graduate Certificate in Afro-Latin American Studies
### General Information
The Graduate Certificate in Afro-Latin American Studies employs a multidisciplinary approach to the study of the economic, social, cultural, and historical experiences of people of African descent and their communities in the Latin American Region. These include descendants from those brought over during the Transatlantic slave trade and those who came in subsequent migration movements. The certificate is designed to complement students’ professional and academic interests and qualifications and who want to excel in a variety of careers demanding expertise in international, Transnational, and multicultural issues.
Thanks to the diversity of areas of research interests of the core and affiliate AADS faculty, students will be able to choose courses that focus more specifically on Afro-Latin Americans living in both the region and in other geographic areas where Afro-Latin Americans have migrated to and/or wherein their national governments have been engaged on behalf of national industries.
The Certificate places a strong emphasis on Afro-Latin American cultural expressions in all their national, sub-regional, temporal, and socioeconomic diversities. It offers coordinated insights into the ongoing challenges Afrodescendant communities face locally, nationally, and internationally. It also focuses on the ways in which Afro-Latin American communities and individuals have developed political and creative strategies for survival in the midst of, and resistance to, racism and political, economic, and social oppression.
The Certificate will provide numerous opportunities for enrolled students to explore Afro Latin American populations in economic processes of various kinds, underlining the specific challenges they might face.
