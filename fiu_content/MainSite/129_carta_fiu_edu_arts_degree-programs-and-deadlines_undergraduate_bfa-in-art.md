How have specific experiences contributed to the way you make art?
### **Transfer Applicants & Current FIU Students: Upload Unofficial Transcripts**
Transfer applicants and current FIU Students are required to upload a copy of their unofficial transcripts. The Department will review the unofficial transcripts to confirm if the degree prerequisites have been completed. Eligibility for consideration to the BFA program is contingent on having the degree prerequisite courses – emphasis on the four foundation courses: ART 1201C, ART 1203C, ART 2300C, and ART 2330C.
**New incoming Transfer applicants without these foundation courses, including those who completed the four courses but failed to meet the Academic Standard of 2.75 GPA may be considered ineligible for the BFA.**
Portfolios are reviewed by a committee of faculty members. Decision notifications are generally sent out within a month of each deadline closing.
## Important information: Eligibility for submitting BFA Portfolio
Current FIU Students interested in switching over into one of the BFA degree options must be below 75 credits earned and must have already completed the four foundations course requirements. The four foundations courses must be completed with a minimum GPA of 2.75 as per the BFA Academic Standards.
  * ART 1201C 2D Design
  * ART 1203C 3D Design
  * ART 2300C Beginning Drawing
  * ART 2330C Beginning Figure Drawing


### **Academic Standards**
To progress into upper-division BFA courses, students must complete the four lower division foundation courses (12 credits) with a minimum GPA of 2.75 or greater in two attempts or fewer.
#### These courses include:
  * ART 1201C 2D Design
  * ART 1203C 3D Design
  * ART 2300C Beginning Drawing
  * ART 2330C Beginning Figure Drawing


Drops after the add/drop period, which result in a DR grade are considered an attempt in the course and count as an unsuccessful enrollment. Students who do not satisfy this requirement will be advised to change major to other degrees such as BA in Art History or BA in Interdisciplinary Studies.
