##  Overview 
As our world becomes more technologically advanced, so do our devices and the way they use energy. Today’s machines and equipment are designed to use less and do more in today’s industries. From tiny microchips to huge power station generators, electrical engineers are helping environmentally conscious organizations find cleaner ways to derive and use energy to improve sustainability for greater efficiencies, savings and environmental impacts. They’re also helping organizations and the federal agencies shore up existing infrastructure as they maintain and problem-solve machinery.FIU’s online Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering offers students training in the areas of electronics and electromagnetism, nanotechnology, power and energy systems, communications, controls, bio-engineering and computers. The online program helps graduates become critical thinkers, creative problem solvers and life-long learners. Our graduates are trained to stay current in their field of expertise and to excel in their respective organizations. Furthermore, the electrical engineering program provides students with a solid foundation necessary for pursuing advanced studies in the field of electrical engineering.
  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-science-in-electrical-engineering.php)
Electrical engineering expertise will be needed to design distribution systems related to new technologies. As new discoveries in technologies are made, electrical engineers will work hand-in-hand to make innovative designs a tangible reality. A degree in electrical engineering will offer students the needed instruction to fill key roles in new developments with solar arrays, semiconductors and communications technologies. As we move toward cleaner energy sourcing and upgrade existing power grids, electrical engineers will lead the way for our nation’s projects as we enhance our infrastructure. Moreover, electrical engineers may play a role in assisting with the automation of various production processes.
Learn to build, repair and calibrate equipment on-site. Also, understand how to troubleshoot and solve developmental programs through testing electrical systems. Students will become fully versed in circuit board, processor, and chip use in maintenance and function of electrical equipment. Along the same lines, they will also learn to integrate computer hardware and software applications and programming to assist with equipment analysis.
The FIU online Electrical Engineering program offers a well-rounded program of study that is relevant to today’s industries. Graduates will be prepared with the knowledge, skills and abilities to compete in a high-demand field.
**Career Opportunities**
Graduates with a degree in electrical engineering can be found in an array of manufacturing industries and organizations: transportation (automotive, marine, railroad, aerospace); government agencies such as national defense, research and the military; consumer electronics devices and computers; construction; lighting; and telecommunications.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for electrical engineers was $94,210 in May 2016 and the highest 10 percent earned more than $149,040. The agency also projects that the job outlook for electrical engineers will grow at a rate of nine percent from 2018 to 2026.
