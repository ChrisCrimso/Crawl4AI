# Certificate in Global Black Studies
The Global Black Studies Certificate provides degree-seeking FIU students with an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the global, economic, cultural, and historical experiences of people of African descent. The Certificate complements students’ work in their major fields of study at the undergraduate level while fostering greater understanding of Black global presences..Students may choose courses that will allow them to focus more specifically on either U.S. born African Americans or communities of the African diaspora internationally.
The Certificate places a strong emphasis on African diasporic cultural expressions in all their regional, temporal, and socioeconomic diversities. It offers coordinated insights into the ongoing challenges black communities face locally and internationally. It also focuses on the ways in which African diasporic communities and individuals have developed political and creative strategies for survival in the midst of, and resistance to, racism and political, economic, and social oppression. The particular interests of students enrolled in the certificate program are catered to by the diversity of research and teaching interests of the core and affiliate faculty of AADS,
