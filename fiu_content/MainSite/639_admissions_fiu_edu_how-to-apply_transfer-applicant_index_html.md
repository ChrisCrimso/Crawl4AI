## Weâ€™re Here to Help
Follow this checklist to apply and if you need help, just contact an [FIU admissions counselor](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/find-your-counselor/index.html).
In response to the [Chancellor of the Florida Board of Governors Emergency Order 2024-E0-01,](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BOG-EO-24-01.pdf) Florida International University is working to remove barriers for those students seeking to transfer to a Florida university because of a well-founded fear of discrimination, harassment, intimidation or violence at an out-of-state, degree-granting, accredited institution within the United States. To ensure adherence to the order, if you are an applicant intending to undertake academic studies within FIU, please complete our [online form](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=4438092) and one of our Admissions staff will contact you regarding next steps.
### 1. Verify Transfer Credits
Whether you have a few credits or you have your associates degree, you need to verify your transfer credits. The process determines which of your earned credit hours are transferable to FIU. FIU may not accept all credits and certain credits may not count for the same classes (for example an English course at one college may not count as an English credit at FIU). You can verify your credits by:
  * Searching the [Transfer Equivalency Database](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/ted/)
  * Using [transfer guides](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/transfer-guides/)
  * Learning more about the [transfer credit policy](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/policy/)


**Military Transfer Students** - Learn more about transferring military credits and find out how to receive your educational benefits from the office of [Veterans and Military Affairs](https://studentaffairs.fiu.edu/get-support/veteran-and-military-affairs/index.php).
### 2. Apply for Financial Aid
Filing for FAFSA before the [deadline](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines) will make it easier to calculate and deliver your financial aid awards. You should file for FAFSA even if you aren't sure you'll qualify. Search for scholarships you could qualify for early as deadlines to apply may vary.
### 3. Start your Application
The online application requires a $30 application fee. Please be prepared to make this payment when you start your application.
**Traditional transfer students** â€“ [Apply Now](https://pslinks.fiu.edu/psc/cslinks/EMPLOYEE/CAMP/c/OAA_ONLINE_APPLICATION.OAA_SIGNON_COMP.GBL?Page=OAA_APPLICATION01&Action=U&TEMPLATE_ID=FIU_UGRD)
**Connect4Success students** - [Reactivate your application](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/connect4success/prepare-to-transfer/index.html) on MyFIU.
### 4. Submit Transcript(s)
Submit official transcripts from **all** post-secondary institutions/colleges or universities youâ€™ve attended. If you have **12â€“29 transferable credits** , you must also provide SAT/ACT/CLT scores and your high school transcript. If you have **30 or more transferable credits** and earned a â€˜Câ€™ or higher in both ENC1101 (or equivalent) and a college-level math course, you are **not required** to submit standardized test scores or a high school transcript.**Transcripts must be submitted by the application deadline.** Applications without transcripts will be considered **incomplete** and will be **rejected**.
### 5. Submit Exam Scores
You must submit exam scores separately, even if they are already on your transcript. This applies to advanced placement (AP), CLEP, or any other exam credit scores. AP scores must be a 3 or higher. Scores submitted after the application deadline will not be considered on your application. See [accepted exam credits](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/credit-by-exam-tables/).
### 6. Submit Residency Documentation
Residency status is used primarily to determine whether students pay in-state or out-of-state tuition. Whether you are a Florida resident, U.S. resident or international student, you are required to submit proof of residency. Failing to provide residency documentation will delay your enrollment.
[Residency Forms and Information](https://onestop.fiu.edu/student-records-myfiu/personal-records/declare-residency/)
Residency Status
Your proof of residency is used for tuition and financial aid purposes only. Undocumented or DACA students [may qualify for in-state tuition](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/waiver-non-resident-waiver-form.pdf) in certain circumstances and some private scholarships.
### 7. Check Application Status
When you finish your application, you will be assigned a Panther ID and within 1-3 week days you will have access to your MyFIU account where you can [check your application status](https://onestop.fiu.edu/admissions/application-status/).
If you receive your acceptance letter, congratulations! You're on your way. Start the [Admitted](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admitted/index.html) checklist to enroll in FIU.
If your application is denied, you have the option to appeal the decision if your grades have improved or if you have retaken a test for a higher score.
