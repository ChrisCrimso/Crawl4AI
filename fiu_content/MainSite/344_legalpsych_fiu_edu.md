# PhD in Psychology: Legal Psychology
Our Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology with a major in Legal Psychology focuses on issues such as witness memory, interrogations, investigative interviewing, lineups, deception detection and juror decision-making. FIU is one of the few universities in the world with a doctoral concentration in legal psychology.
Our program provides a solid foundation in the traditional and emerging research at the intersection of psychology and the criminal justice system. Students complete a series of courses designed to provide a thorough understanding of psychological theory as well as applied and basic research. Students are actively involved in research throughout their time in the program. Note that our program does not provide training for a career as a forensic psychologist.
The department of psychology is committed to a student body that is representative of the community in which it is located and the greater global society in which its alumni will work, teach, serve and conduct research. To this end, the department aligns with the mission of an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) which is to support expansion of educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans and other underrepresented populations.
