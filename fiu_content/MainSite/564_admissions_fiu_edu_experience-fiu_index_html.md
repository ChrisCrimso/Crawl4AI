# Experience FIU
We opened our doors in 1972 with a mission of bringing affordable, high-quality education to the South Florida. Still one of the state’s youngest universities, we’ve made good on that promise. We’ve developed nationally ranked academic programs, earned the Carnegie Foundation’s highest designation for research activity and built the region’s only public schools of law and medicine. Along the way, more than 300,000 students have earned their degrees here and our Panther alumni family now spans the globe. Ready to join our FIU family? Experience FIU to learn more.

## Life in Miami
** _Vibrant. Energetic. Active._** That's FIU. That's the global city of Miami—the backdrop for your FIU education. From world-renowned nightlife to white sand beaches to cultural establishments like Art Basel and the South Beach Wine and Food Festival — Miami is a city teeming with life and beauty.
But Miami’s tropical breezes attract more than just tourists. It’s also home to some of the largest national and international companies, hospitals, medical centers, research institutes, and biotechnology companies. That means lots of opportunity for jobs and internships.
There's something for everyone in the Magic City. See what else Miami and FIU have to offer.
