The Golden Scholars program is an admissions pathway for select first-generation and Financial Aid Recipients. Students selected to be Golden Scholars will participate in an intensive six-week residential summer bridge program that offers academic preparation, individualized advising, and personal attention from faculty, staff, and peers. Students in the program will have the opportunity to sharpen their academic skills and develop a support network of students, faculty, and staff by becoming familiar with the FIU community and its many resources.
