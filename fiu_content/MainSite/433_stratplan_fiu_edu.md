# FIU 2025-2030 Strategic Plan
## Experience Impact 2030
As a [preeminent public research university](https://www.fiu.edu/lp/preeminence/), anchor institution and driver of economic prosperity, FIU is focused on student success, research excellence, forging strategic alliances and community engagement.
The Experience Impact 2030 strategic plan encompasses the forward-thinking and innovative work of our students and faculty in classrooms, laboratories, studios, the community and on research projects around the world; of our staff in the administering of the university’s operations; and of our over 320,000 unstoppable FIU alumni.

## Our VisionTop 30 by 2030
The Experience Impact 2030 strategic plan enables us to build on our already strong history of success. By 2030, FIU will be a Top 30 public university and will strategically redefine the role and impact of the public research university. As a result, FIU will continue to deliver a leading return on investment for our students and serve as a model for other public institutions of higher education. To do this, we have anchored our 2030 plan with three strategic focus areas, while emphasizing our commitment to our mission through three foundational pillars. The three strategic focus areas address complex and demanding challenges in the areas of Environment & Environmental Resilience, Health, and Technology & Innovation. FIU will solidify our core mission and facilitate success of these focus areas through a deliberate concentration on three pillars: the FIU Experience, Research Excellence, and Strategic Alliances.
These strategic focus areas and pillars reinforce the unique value proposition that FIU will offer by ensuring that every FIU student has an opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and experience needed to excel in their career; that faculty and students have the ability to access and engage in cutting-edge research and creative activities; and that we will have the connected systems and infrastructure in place to support the scale of our strategic alliances. We aim to ensure that all of our efforts are also providing maximum economic impact for the State of Florida and our community.
### Our Focus
To achieve our vision, key commitments are embedded within each strategic focus area and pillar. These include:
Creating Exceptional OpportunitiesFIU will focus on optimizing our dynamic innovative culture to build world-class academic and experiential opportunities. This ensures that FIU continues its path of excellence as a leading destination university.
Leveraging Evidence-based Outcomes and Data-driven Decision-makingFIU has achieved incredible success due to our commitment to delivering performance outcomes and understanding how to best utilize data to achieve those outcomes.
Expanding our Impact Through Investing in our CommunityFIU has always been dedicated to making an impact while creating a positive culture for members of our university community. FIU will continue to evolve with changes in technology and the world of work by ensuring that students, faculty and staff have the tools and resources to succeed.
Implementing a Sustainable and Agile InfrastructureBuilding upon our history of “making it happen” and our institutional agility, we will provide financial, technological, and physical resources that prepare us for the challenges of the future. Flexibility and organizational nimbleness have been, and will remain, assets to us.

## Our Process
Beginning in the summer of 2023, under the leadership of then President Kenneth A. Jessell and Provost, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Elizabeth M. Béjar, FIU began the 2030 Strategic Planning Process, and simultaneously launched the Campus Master Planning Process led by Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Aime Martinez. The concurrent development of FIU’s Strategic and Campus Master Plans provided for a future-focused planning exercise in a coordinated and interconnected manner.
Following a strategic planning visioning session with university academic and operational leadership, three strategic planning pillar committees were appointed around: the FIU Experience, Research Excellence and Strategic Alliances. These committees engaged faculty, staff and student leadership and were informed by robust discussion, debate, and data provided by the Analysis and Information Management (AIM) team to ensure data-driven decision-making.
More than a dozen university strategic planning workshops were hosted, engaging thousands of university community members in discussions, university-wide surveys, and meetings.
The [FIU Board of Trustees](https://trustees.fiu.edu) hosted multiple meetings, including two workshops in April and August 2024, and the final Strategic Plan was approved by the Board of Trustees in September 2024.
