# Graduate Nursing
The career starting point for most nurses begins at a patientâ€™s bedside. But for many, the desire to move to other settings of influence such as community clinics, corporate boardrooms, private practice, research facilities and government offices requires a commitment to advanced levels of nursing education, practice and analysis.
[Nationally ranked among U.S. News & World Report Best Graduate Nursing Schools](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-nursing-schools/florida-international-university-33053), the **FIU Graduate Nursing** unit of the [Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences](https://cnhs.fiu.edu/index.html) offers accredited **Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degrees, Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degrees** and **post-graduate certificates** for concentrations in:
  * **Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner**
  * **Family Nurse Practitioner**
  * **Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner**
  * **Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner**
  * **Nurse Educator**

## DNP: Moving the Nursing Profession Forward
The Doctor of Nursing Practice is a complementary alternative to research-focused doctorates, such as a PhD in Nursing or Doctor of Nursing Science (DNS) that centers on implementing the science developed by nurse researchers. It builds on the traditional MSN nursing curriculum by providing education in evidence-based practice, quality improvement, systems leadership and other key areas.
The successful outcomes from evidence-based practice and interventions delivered by nurse practitioners is fueling the push toward a DNP as the appropriate level of preparation for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to enter clinical practice.
FIU Graduate Nursing is supporting this professional evolution by offering the traditional post-masterâ€™s DNP and a direct-entry Post-BSN to DNP. The Post-BSN to DNP program curriculum is streamlined to award the MSN degree (i.e. Adult-Gerontology, Pediatric, Psychiatric-Mental Health, or Family Health clinical specialty), allowing the students to sit for Advanced Practice Nursing national certification at the MSN level and continue enrollment into the last semesters of doctoral preparation.
