Welcome to the FIU Policies and Procedures Library website, the official repository for university-wide policies and procedures. The University-wide Policy Library and development process is managed by the University Office of Compliance & Integrity. Individual policies are owned by the Responsible Offices charged with developing, updating, administering, communicating, training, monitoring and ensuring compliance with the policy. Please keep in mind that unit-level guidance that may apply to your activities would be maintained by individual units and not found on the University policy website..
