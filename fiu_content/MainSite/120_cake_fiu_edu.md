The National Science Foundation's (NSF) FIU-FAU-Greenwich Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement (CAKE) was established to develop long-term partnerships among industry, academe and government. The Center is supported primarily by industry center members, with NSF taking a supporting role in its development, evolution, and core funding. 
The Center's mission is to conduct industry-relevant studies and deployments in the representation, management, storage, analysis, search and social aspects of large and complex data sets, with particular applications in geospatial location-based data, disaster mitigation, healthcare, transportation, and town planning. 
The Center's Director, Naphtali Rishe, is the inaugural Outstanding University Professor of FIU and the principal investigator of $55M in grants. The FAU Site Director, Borko Furht, is the Chairperson of the FAU Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
The Center also performs R&D on Computational Transportation ([Computational Transportation Lab](http://cake.fiu.edu/CTL_Computational_Transportation_Lab)) and [Health Information Technology](http://HIT.fiu.edu), including [COVID-19 data analytics](http://cake.fiu.edu/COVID-FL) and Precision Medicine. 
Center affiliation is open to industrial members and government agencies. Affiliation benefits include early access to the Center's research innovations, twice-yearly meetings on a university campus, and opportunities to interact with faculty, students, and industry peers. Benefits include: 
— Access to students trained in industry and government relevant research challenges 
— The University waives almost the entire overhead on industrial contributions to the Center, so contributions go further 
— Affiliate representatives form an Industrial Advisory Board which has a voice in the Center's research direction and long-term strategy 
— Members direct which I/UCRC research projects their membership fees are to be invested in 
— Members can utilize at no charge I/UCRC technology, including its mapping engine [TerraFly](http://terrafly.com) and its applications suitable for the member's activities. 
— Members have access to and benefit from the results of all I/UCRC projects funded with any membership fees. This creates a multiplier effect — a member paying a fee of $50,000 benefits from at least $600,000 worth of research. 
— The Center can accept funds from any government agency, normally without a bidding process and almost without overhead, via an intra-government transfer mechanism facilitated by NSF. These funds can be directed to any aspect of the Center's research, including work beneficial the Center's industrial members, and can also be used for collaborative research with industrial members. 
_Member Commitment_
a. a regular industrial member committing a first-year membership fee of $50K or more b. a small business member committing a first-year membership fee of $5K
