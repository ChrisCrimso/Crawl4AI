Promoting humanities scholarship, appreciation and impact
# Center for the Humanities in an Urban Environment
We are the humanities hub of FIU, fostering arts and culture from the heart of Miami. Working with partners across the university and beyond, we show how the humanities can respond to key issues of our times.

## We're Here: Queer Artists Celebrate Pride through Art, Music, and Protest
We met for ["We're Here"](https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/were_here_queer_artists_celebrate_pride_through_art_music_and_protest) as LGBTQ+ Pride Month came to a close. Our speakers reflected on the purpose of Pride; discussing the unique mix of celebration and advocacy that characterizes Pride events; and exploring how art, music, poetry, and performance shape the experiences and subjectivities of those who participate in Pride.

## Juneteenth: Education, Celebration, and Healing: A Teach-In
This [virtual, public-facing program](https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/juneteenth_education_celebration_and_healing_a_teach-in) in honor of Juneteenth explored topics related to the history of the holiday, the ways it is experienced and celebrated by African Americans today, and the myriad social justice issues that cohere around it. The program brought together public figures, scholars, activists and artists, who together shed needed light on the past and inspire a hopeful vision for the future.
