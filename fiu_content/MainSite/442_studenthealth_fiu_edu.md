# Student Health Clinics
## Student Health Center - South Building Closure
**We wish to inform you of the scheduled temporary closure of the Student Health Center (SHC)’s south building, effective April 25, 2025**. This closure, which will last the majority of the Summer A term, is necessary to facilitate essential maintenance of the HVAC system.
  * **The Student Health Clinics** will operate only out of the Blue Clinic (north building, first floor). Students may still call [305-348-8385](tel:305-348-8385) or access the student health portal for assistance.
  * **Healthy Living Program** will move health education to telehealth and other direct services will be relocated (north building, second floor). Students may still call [305-348-4020](tel:305-348-4020) or access the student health portal for assistance. 


We regret any inconvenience this may cause and sincerely appreciate your patience and cooperation as we undertake these improvements to enhance our facilities.
For the most current updates, please follow our social media channels (**@fiushw**). Should you have additional inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact Student Health & Wellness at shwad@fiu.edu.
The Student Health Clinics provide affordable and easy-to-access care designed just for students (you). We treat everything from common illnesses to routine check-ups, offer psychiatric care, and provide services like PPD tests and vaccines for program requirements. At our clinic, we do more than just treat illnesses—we empower students to thrive academically and personally by providing education, support, and resources that promote a healthy lifestyle tailored to you. We're always adapting to the changing needs of students to offer well-rounded care in a welcoming non-judgmental environment. By working with our university and community resources, we make sure every student gets personalized support to stay healthy and thrive. Our goal is simple: Keep Students Healthy!
