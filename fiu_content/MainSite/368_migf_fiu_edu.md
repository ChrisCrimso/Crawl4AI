With concerts during the day, concerts every evening with some of today’s finest artists, master classes, a competition and other events, including world premieres of what are sure to be important works, I can scarcely believe it could have been done! 
> Dr. Albert Kunze, Recordings Editor, Soundboard Magazine, GFA

> “
