### Payment Plan
Students with a qualified tuition and fees balance greater than $200 are eligible to enroll in an installment plan. The FIU installment Payment plan allows students to pay their tuition in two or three equal installments.
There is a $15 service charge to enroll in the Payment Plan. The $15 service charge is due with the first installment.
## Admission Scholarships
FIU awards merit-based scholarships to admitted first-time-in-college (FTIC) students. FIU will automatically consider students for these merit-based scholarships when they submit and complete the freshman admissions application for Early Fall/ Fall 2025 by**November 1, 2024** , for those attending Florida high schools and**December 3, 2024** for those who attend out-of-state or overseas high schools. 
Students should submit a complete application for admission, including the application fee/waiver, and official SAT, ACT, or CLT test scores by this date for scholarship consideration. 
Applicants must have their scores sent directly to FIU when they register for tests so the scores can be received by the university in time for admission for scholarship consideration. Recommended last test dates for scholarship consideration are:
  * **ACT** - September 14, 2024
  * **CLT** - September 21, 2024
  * **SAT** - October 5, 2024


 _To be eligible students must be a citizen of the United States, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, or an international student to receive the F-1 visa to study in the United States (or another eligible visa)._
 _Consideration for merit awards is based on the same academic records used for admission and residency status. No additional applications are required. Scholarship funding is limited. The Scholarship Office reviews admitted FTIC students until all scholarship funding has been allocated._
 _Non-Resident/Out-of-State Tuition Waiver_** _Must complete application to FIU by December 3, 2024_**
Out-of-state reduction awards are disbursed as waivers that decrease the total cost of attendance but only apply toward out-of-state tuition. If a student's residency is updated to in-state for tuition purposes after enrollment, the merit-based tuition waiver will no longer apply, the award will be canceled and**is not** replaced by the Florida resident award. 
 _**Please note:** The out-of-state, merit-based tuition reduction waivers cannot be combined with another tuition waiver scholarship (Grandparent Waiver) since both scholarships waive the same portion of non-resident tuition. _
**Benefits:**
  * Guaranteed admission to the Honors College
  * Access to the Honors College Early Assurance Programs for the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and FIU College of Law 
  * Priority registration when choosing classes


**Gold and Blue**
Gold and Blue Scholarships are awarded to entering students to recognize outstanding academic performance. Awards are distributed over four years and range from:
  * $1,000 to $12,000 for Florida residents (deadline November 1, 2024)
  * $4,000 to $24,000 for non-Florida residents (deadline December 3, 2024)


_Gold and Blue scholarships cannot be stacked with other forms of FIU merit aid._
