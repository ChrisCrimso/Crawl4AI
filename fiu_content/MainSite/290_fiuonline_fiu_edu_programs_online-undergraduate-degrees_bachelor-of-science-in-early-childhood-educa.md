  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-science-in-early-childhood-education-arts.php)
Early childhood education and development benefits children, their families and their communities. The early years of a child's life is the most critical time of growth and learning. In fact, 85 percent of a child's brain develops by age five, before a child even enters school. Early childhood specialists have a tremendous influence on shaping a child's future, helping young children to thrive, learn and transition successfully to elementary school.
### **Degree Objectives**
The Early Childhood Development Major focuses on understanding the learning and development during the early childhood years. Students will learn about the cognitive, language and social/emotional development of young children within the context of family and community studies. Although this track and degree do not result in a teaching certification, students also learn about general and early education practices and curricula.
This program provides theoretical and practical knowledge in the following areas:
    * Educational Psychology
