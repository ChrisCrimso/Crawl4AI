# Contact the Disability Resource Center
Welcome to the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at FIU. Our aim is to guide and support students with disabilities throughout their college experience, from transitioning into FIU to graduating from our university, the DRCâ€™s goal is to help you be successful.
As your partners in success, we are committed to you. Serving as the one-stop shop for your disability service needs, the DRC provides the resources to facilitate a smooth transition to university life. By providing one-on-one consultation throughout your academic journey, our DRC staff are a specialized resource for you.
## New to DRC? Schedule a Welcome Appointment
Whether you're on campus or fully online, students with a disability can schedule a Welcome Appointment to get connected with the DRC. Appointments are held through Zoom, by phone, or in person with your DRC Access Consultant. You'll discuss the services we provide, the benefits of receiving accommodations, the resources available to you, and methods to stay on track with your academic plan. Supporting disability documentation requirements are discussed and any questions about the process can be answered. 
[Request information](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=722953)
## Exam Check In
Welcome to the Disability Resource Center Testing Queue. We aim to streamline your testing process by allowing you to check in online (on your phone, tablet, or laptop) at your convenience. Once you receive a text message with a testing location, you have 15 minutes to arrive at the assigned testing room. Feel free to use the FIU Campus Map button below if you need to refer to it to find your testing room. If you have any questions, please call 305-348-3532 or visit the Graham Center Room 190.

## Real students, real achievements
FIU produces REAL Triumphs graduates that meet and surpass expectations and demonstrate the competencies of teamwork, collaboration, and leadership â€“ but none stand out like our graduates with disabilities. Not only do they meet the requisite standards of the university, but they do this in an environment often designed without their learning and physical needs in mind. As their partners in success, the DRC collaborates to ensure opportunities for full university participation.
