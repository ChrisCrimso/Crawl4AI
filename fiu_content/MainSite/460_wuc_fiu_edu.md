# Wolfe University Center
The Wolfe University Center (WUC) enhances the student experiences through a supportive and engaging environment.
The WUC is the social and geographic center of the beautiful Biscayne Bay Campus. We are home to cultural, educational, and recreational programs whether they occur in our recently renovated multi-purpose ballrooms, our newly opened student video game lounge, our world class exercise and aquatics facility, or our performing arts center, the Mary Anne Wolfe Theater. Stop by and find out why so many think of the Wolfe University Center as home.

Day-use lockers are available at no cost for individual use and outfitted with independent combination locks. They are located in the second floor hallway by the main stairway in Panther Square. 
After the building closes, property left in the lockers will be removed by staff, bagged, and brought to the Wolfe University Center Information Desk. After 30 days, unclaimed property will be sent to FIU's Property Control.

  * [Digital Signage](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/wolfe-university-center/#panel-N10398-3)
The Wolfe University Center offers free marketing of on-campus, student-centered events on its LCD screens. 
LCD Screen Dimension Specifications

    * **WUC Panther Square and Campus Life Vertical Screens:** 1080px by 1920px
Electronic Message Board - Best Practices
    * EMBs target drivers. Because of this, your audience has about ** _six seconds to read your flyer._**
    * Include a **headline and sub-headline,** if applicable. Please try to produce a visual hierarchy with the size of your text.
    * **Characters:** Max. 150 
    * **Font size:** Min. 42pt in Photoshop at 72dpi.
    * **Call-to-action:** website link, location, phone number, etc.
      * Short URLs are easier for viewers to digest. If your URL is long, consider using [FIU's URL shortener](https://go.fiu.edu/).
To submit your artwork for approval or if you have any questions regarding our digital signage, please email wucsignage@fiu.edu
