# Women's Center
The Women’s Center at Florida International University (FIU) provides all Panthers with programs and services related to their intellectual, professional, personal growth while meeting the needs and enhancing the lives of the varied women populations on campus. We educate and advocate for systemic changes that will improve the lives of everyone at FIU.
We encourage Panthers to engage with us through our events and services, which are funded and supported by student fees that have been allocated by the Student Government Association. All our services and initiatives are open to all FIU students.
## Join the FIU Women's Center
In the Women’s Center, we provide various opportunities for students to get involved and engage with us throughout the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of our popular programming includes the Women Who Lead Conference, Miami Black Women’s Forum, our celebrations for Women’s Herstory Month, and our affinity spaces. We also have opportunities for volunteers and interns! Please continue below to learn more.
