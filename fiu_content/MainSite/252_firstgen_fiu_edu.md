## First-Gen at FIU
A student is first generation if neither of the student’s parents earned a college degree at the baccalaureate level or higher or, in the case of any individual who regularly resided with and received support from only one parent, if that parent did not earn a baccalaureate degree.
First-generation students are part of the foundation on which we built our University. FIU connects first-generation students to a quality education and high-impact practices that enable them to achieve academic success at all levels.
Ensuring first-generation student success is woven into every FIU initiative, service and program and it is intrinsic to our identity. Empowering first-generation students is not the role, vision or mission of one unit but it is the charge of the FIU community.

## ![FirstGen Forward Network Champion logo](https://firstgen.fiu.edu/_assets/images/firstgen-forward-network-leader-logo-3.png)
FirstGen Forward, formerly known as the Center for First-generation Student Success, launched in June 2017 with the mission of being the premier source of evidence-based practices, professional development, and knowledge creation for the higher education community to advance the success of first-generation students. In continuing this mission, the organization launched the FirstGen Forward Network, which offers a national model for scaling holistic first-generation student success by engaging and empowering institutions.
FIU is proud to be [designated a FirstGen Forward Network Champion](https://news.fiu.edu/2025/fiu-named-a-champion-among-universities-nationwide-for-first-generation-student-success), joining only 32 institutions nationwide to have earned this title, which signals a continued, institution-wide commitment to these students' success.
## 2024 First-Generation College Celebration
November 8 marks the annual National First-Generation College Celebration, honoring the anniversary of the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965.
