## Educational Expenses
Your educational expenses can be classified into two main categories: direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs include payments made directly to FIU, including tuition and fees, books and supplies purchased from the university bookstore, and on-campus housing and meal plans. Additionally, any expenses not directly paid to the university fall under the category of indirect costs, such as transportation, personal expenses, and miscellaneous expenditures.
