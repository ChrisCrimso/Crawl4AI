# [Western Hemisphere Security Analysis Center](https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/whemsac)
The Western Hemisphere Security Analysis Center (WHEMSAC) is jointly operated and directed by US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) and the Applied Research Center at Florida International University (FIUARC) and provides a multidisciplinary approach to regional security analysis. WHEMSAC brings together regional experts from government, academic, private sectors and civil society focused on advancing the understanding of critical issues within Latin America and the Caribbean that affect regional security and stability. WHEMSAC also identifies and analyzes non-traditional opportunities for information and technology exchanges between the U.S. Government and Western Hemisphere nations that directly enhance regional security.
