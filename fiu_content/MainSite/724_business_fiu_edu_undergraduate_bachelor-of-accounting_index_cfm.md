## Learning Goals
The Florida Board of Governors has mandated that public universities in Florida develop and annually assess Academic Learning Compacts for each Undergraduate degree program. Academic Learning Compacts identify the skills you should acquire provided you follow your major's prescribed course of study. These skills, known collectively as Student Learning Outcomes, describe the core competencies and learning expectations you are expected to display and the College is required to assess for each major.
