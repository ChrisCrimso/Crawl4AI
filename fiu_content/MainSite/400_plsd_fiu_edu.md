## The Project on Language and Spatial Development
The Project on Language and Spatial Development at Florida International University, directed by Dr. Shannon Pruden, conducts cutting-edge research on language development and spatial development. Using state-of-the-art technology, such as eye-tracking and structural MRI, we are beginning to discover how children learn their first and second languages, and how they learn about the spatial world in which they live. Our research on developing spatial competence informs educational practice in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Our research is published in scientific journals and books. Contact us to learn more about how you can contribute to the understanding of childrenâ€™s development! Or sign up for the [FIU Cub Club](https://tinyurl.com/FIUCubClub) to hear more about studies in our lab and other FIU developmental labs!
