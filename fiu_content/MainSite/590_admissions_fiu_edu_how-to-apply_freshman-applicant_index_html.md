[Financial Aid Deadlines](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines) [Scholarship Deadlines](https://admissions.fiu.edu/cost-and-aid/scholarships/index.html)
## Weâ€™re Here to Help
Get guidance from application to graduation. Visit the [Iâ€™m First](https://imfirst.org/) website or talk with an FIU [admissions counselor](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/find-your-counselor/index.html) for advice on your FIU journey.
### 1. Take the SAT, ACT or CLT
Students should take the SAT, ACT and/or CLT in their junior year, but no later than the fall of their senior year. Test scores submitted after the deadline will not be considered on applications or scholarships for the upcoming term. Official scores for the SAT can be sent through [CollegeBoard.org](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/sending-scores) (code: 5206), ACT scores through [ACT.org](http://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores.html) (code: 0776) and CLT scores through [cltexam.com](https://www.cltexam.com/).
### 2. Apply for Financial Aid 
Filing for FAFSA before the [deadline](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines) will make it easier to calculate and deliver your financial aid awards. You should file for FAFSA even if you arenâ€™t sure youâ€™ll qualify. Search for scholarships you could qualify for early as deadlines to apply may vary.
### 3. Start your Application
Interested applicants can apply to FIU through [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/explore/florida-international-university). If you have applied through Common App, you **should not** submit a separate application through FIU's application portal.
Applicants will be required to pay a $30 USD application fee or use an SAT/ACT fee waiver. If you are using an SAT/ACT fee waiver please indicate that on the Common App when submitting your application.
### 4. Submit Transcript(s)
FIU requires all incoming students, whether first-year or transfer students, to submit all official academic transcripts from every high school or college/university attended prior to submitting their application. Applications will not be reviewed until they are complete. Your transcript(s) should be sent directly from **all** secondary schools, colleges, and universities you have attended.
Transcripts received by FIU become the property of FIU and will not be returned to the applicant or forwarded to any other institution. Please do not send us your original transcript/diploma if no other copy exists.
For international credentials, a certified copy issued by the previous institutionâ€™s registration office may be submitted. Please note that the translation is separate from the official transcript requirement (both are necessary).
### 5. Submit Exam Scores
Submit scores separately from the testing agency. This applies to Advanced Placement (AP), CLEP, International Baccalaureate (IB), or any other exam credit scores. AP scores must be a 3 or higher. Scores submitted after the application deadline will not be considered on your application. See [accepted exam credits](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/credit-by-exam-tables/). The only scores accepted as "official" from a high school transcript are SAT and ACT scores.
### 6. Submit Residency Documentation
Residency status is used primarily to determine whether students pay in-state or out-of-state tuition. Whether you are a Florida resident, U.S. resident, or international student, you are required to submit proof of residency. Failing to provide residency documentation will delay your enrollment.
[Residency Forms and Information](https://onestop.fiu.edu/student-records-myfiu/personal-records/declare-residency/)
Residency Status
Your proof of residency is used for tuition and financial aid purposes only. Undocumented or DACA students [may qualify for in-state tuition](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/waiver-non-resident-waiver-form.pdf) in certain circumstances and some private scholarships.
### 7. Check Application Status
When you finish your application, you will be assigned a Panther ID and within 1-3 business days you will have access to your MyFIU account where you can [check your application status](https://onestop.fiu.edu/admissions/application-status/). 
If you receive your acceptance letter, congratulations! You're on your way. Start the [Admitted](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admitted/index.html) checklist to secure your spot at FIU.
If your application is denied, you may appeal the decision if your grades have improved or if you have retaken a test and achieved a higher score.
Students who have received a letter of deferred admission or alternate term admission:
  * A **deferred admission** decision means that we have not been able to make a decision based on the academic credentials you have submitted. We would like for you to send us your first semester grades in January and/or any new SAT or ACT scores you may have. In addition to receiving a letter, we will also contact you via email. Please make sure to check your email regularly for updated information regarding your deferred admission status. Communicating continued demonstrated interest is not required when you are deferred admission. 


  * If you were**admitted to Early Fall, but applied for Fall** , we understand that not all applicants admitted to Early Fall can begin taking classes in Miami in June. You are offered the opportunity to take online classes over the summer or you can defer your application to spring (January). If you are admitted to summer, regardless of course modality, orientation is in person over the summer, and it is mandatory.
