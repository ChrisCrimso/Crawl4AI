Students are encouraged to double major or pursue a minor in related fields such as political science, economics, geography, modern languages, history, sociology/anthropology, or business. We recommend that students take introductory courses in economics and gain fluency in at least one foreign language. Students may also consider appropriate academic certificates such as those in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Asian Studies, African and African Diaspora Studies, and European Studies.


## Combined B.A. in International Relations/M.A. in International Studies (the "4+1" Degree Pathway)
The combined BA in International Relations and MA in International Studies degree pathway allows highly qualified undergraduate students to pursue an accelerated MA degree in International Studies. Students accepted into this degree pathway will be able to complete the MA degree as much as one year sooner than would otherwise be possible. Students accepted into the International Relations Honors Track are particularly encouraged to apply for this degree pathway.
To be accepted into the combined BA/MA degree pathway, students must submit an online MA program application through their FIU Student Portal by March 15 in their junior year. The link is available by navigating to the Admissions Tile on the student dashboard.
A complete application requires:
  * Current enrollment in BA program in International Relations at FIU
  * Completion of 75 credits of undergraduate coursework
  * GRE
  * GPA of 3.5 or above
  * Two letters of recommendation
  * Statement of purpose discussing research interests


All components of the application must be complete by the March 15 application deadline. Students should consult the graduate catalog and the Politics and International Relations Department website for a more comprehensive discussion of admission requirements. If the application is approved, students will be admitted into the combined BA/MA degree pathway once they have successfully completed 90 credits in their undergraduate degree program. Students in the combined BA/MA degree pathway must apply for their undergraduate degree as soon as possible after having satisfied the degree requirements.
The degree pathway gives students the opportunity to take up to 9 credits of graduate coursework in their senior year that will count toward both the BA and the MA. Successful completion of the BA/MA degree pathway will therefore require a total of 147 unduplicated credit hours. Students will take three 5000 level graduate courses in their senior year and follow the regular MA curriculum after they earn their BA degree. A typical course of study is as follows:
