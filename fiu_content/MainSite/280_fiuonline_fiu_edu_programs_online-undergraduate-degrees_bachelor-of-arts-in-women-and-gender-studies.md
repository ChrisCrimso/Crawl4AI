##  Overview 
The fully online Bachelor of Arts in Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) is an interdisciplinary study of women and gender in cross-cultural and historical perspectives. You'll explore how women's lives have been shaped by history, culture, nationality, class and other elements. The courses in the program are coordinated through FIU's Center for Women's and Gender Studies, founded in 1982, and one of the oldest such scholarly centers in the country. Students have the opportunity to conduct research with faculty on issues related to women and gender.
**Take the next step.**
With FIU Online, you can learn anywhere, anytime. Our interactive technology enables you to watch lectures, get real-time feedback from your instructors and collaborate with classmates on projects. Plus, we provide you with a personal success coach who will provide you with one-on-one guidance every step of the way.
  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-women-and-gender-studies.php)
The Women's and Gender Studies major explores gender inequalities and oppression throughout society—in the workplace, in your community, and at home. You'll hone your analytical, critical thinking and writing skills and become engaged with issues of social change, activism and citizenship. The program is interdisciplinary, and students may select courses from a variety of disciplines, giving you the flexibility to create a program that best reflects your interest and goals.
**Career Opportunities**
A Women's and Gender Studies major develops skills that are highly valued by employers, including critical thinking, research, analysis and presentation skills. But beyond that, graduates gain a unique perspective about the layers of identify, and how racism, sexism, classism and ableism are interconnected—and how to strive for a more just, equal and vibrant society. The demand for expertise in gender and social justice issues is growing across the professions, including law, medicine, social services, teaching, community development, counseling, public policy and research. Additional career paths include advocacy for international women's health and human rights issues. Many graduates go to graduate or professional schools.
The demand for social and community service managers is expected to grow by 21% between 2012 and 2022. Social and community service managers may focus on a specific demographic or challenges, such as domestic violence, hunger or homelessness, and work in variety of settings, including nonprofits, hospitals, social service agencies and government agencies. The media annual wage for social and community service managers was $59,970 in May 2012, with those working in state and local government earning a median annual wage of $69,490 (Occupational Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics).
