##  Overview 
As the world’s industries become increasingly global, the demand for graduates with a background in international studies, such as Asian Studies, has grown. Since its financial crisis decades ago, Asia has become a significant emerging market, and is poised to capture double-digit growth rates in the worldwide e-commerce scene, according to[Research and Markets](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/06/09/1011967/0/en/Southeast-Asia-B2C-E-Commerce-Market-Report-2017.html). Asia is also the Earth’s largest and most populated continent, rich in natural resources and human resources as manufacturing for multinational companies continues to dominate the region. Understanding these facts, the Asian Studies program drives the FIU mission to foster greater international understanding through collaborative engagement with our local and global communities.
The Asian Studies B.A. degree is designed for students who wish to pursue a career that focuses on the region. Classes emphasize a multidisciplinary approach of study and cover language and culture, philosophy and religion, as well as arts and literature. With an in-depth look at China, Japan, India, and Central and Southeast Asia, the program also includes classwork on issues in history, politics, geography, sociology/anthropology, international relations, education and business in the global environment. Moreover, classes provide relevant and current instruction, advising, and experiential opportunities for students in an environment that promotes scholarship, critical thinking, free inquiry and clear and candid communication.
Through this program, students become intellectual analysts of the region’s innate culture and shared history in order to discern current and future demands of industries worldwide.
  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-asian-studies.php)
United States relations with Asia are fluid and changing as our new administration constructs and readdresses international policies. Asia’s emerging market is predicted to experience record growth in e-commerce. As multinational companies enter the Asian market, the need for specific knowledge of the region including its history, languages, culture, as well as government and business environments is more crucial than ever. With globalization and the growing importance of cross-cultural understanding in business and government, graduates will be well-positioned for a wide variety of careers.
Graduates of this fully online program pursue careers in both the private and public sectors. A degree in Asian Studies prepares graduates for employment with international businesses, government entities, education organizations, journalism careers, the travel and tourism industry, social services and programs, as well as information technology, translation services, the art industry, international law, and e-commerce ventures.
