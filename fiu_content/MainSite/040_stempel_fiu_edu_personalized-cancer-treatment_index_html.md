# Transforming Cancer Treatment
Treating cancer isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Researchers at FIU Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work are working on using a new functional precision medicine approach to guide personalized cancer therapies in real-time.
**[Discover the impact of patient-centric medicine](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#intro)**
## Functional Precision Medicine Advantage
FIU cancer researcher [Diana Azzam](https://discovery.fiu.edu/display/person-azzamdiana-jehad) and her lab collaborated with Nicklaus Children’s Hospital and conducted a first-of-its-kind clinical trial to guide personalized treatments for some of the deadliest children’s cancers using a unique functional precision medicine (FPM) approach.
As part of the trial, researchers analyzed and exposed samples of patients' own tumor tissue to more than 120 FDA-approved drugs. Researchers provided the patients’ physicians with the most effective cancer-fighting recommendations for their specific diagnosis.
According to the feasibility study’s results, published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02848-4), 83% of patients who received guided treatments showed improvement. This method provided safer, more readily accessible, effective and affordable options to doctors.

## 83%
Patients who received guided treatments showed improvement.
  * ### Patient Spotlight
Logan Jenner was three years old when doctors diagnosed him with acute myeloid leukemia. After years of treatment, his cancer returned. Out of treatment options, he became a candidate for Azzam’s clinical trial.
As a trial participant, a sample of his tumor was tested to determine which medications were most effective against his cancer. Those tests guided his treatment, and in 33 days, he reached remission and remains cancer-free today, more than two years later.

Trial participant Logan Jenner and FIU cancer researcher Diana Azzam featured on Good Morning America.
## Advancing Precision Medicine Research
The Azzam Lab is continuing its cancer research and actively recruiting participants for additional clinical studies in Florida, seeking to demonstrate that functional precision medicine is a viable approach to treating cancer.
  * Recruiting
### Ex Vivo Drug Sensitivity Testing and Multi-Omics Profiling
This study will explore the feasibility of providing access to personalized treatment options and clinical management recommendations based on FPM to pediatric cancer patients.
Principal Investigators:Diana Azzam, Florida International University Maggie Fader, MD, Nicklaus Children's Hospital
[Learn more about this trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05857969?term=Diana%20Azzam&checkSpell=false&aggFilters=status:rec&rank=1)
  * Recruiting
### FPM for the Treatment of Adult Cancers
Trial participants will undergo drug sensitivity tests and genomic screening. Treating physicians will receive testing results to determine the most appropriate treatment for each patient.
Principal Investigators:Diana Azzam, Florida International University Jorge Manrique-Succar, MD, Cleveland Clinic Florida

## FAQs
Learn how you can get involved or enrolled in our current clinical trials.
  * [What are the differences between the two clinical trials?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-1)
Our clinical trial at Nicklaus Children's Hospital enrolls pediatric patients 21 years of age or younger at the time of enrollment. Our clinical trial at Cleveland Clinic in Weston, FL, will enroll adult patients 18 years of age or older at the time of enrollment.
Both studies will enroll patients with any relapsed or refractory cancer who will be having an upcoming surgery or biopsy.
  * [Who is eligible to participate in the clinical trials?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-2)
Parents/guardians can enroll their children in the pediatric study at Nicklaus Children's Hospital if their child has a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or refractory cancer. Adults interested in enrolling in our adult study at Cleveland Clinic should also have a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or refractory cancer.
Patients should have undergone at least one prior treatment before enrolling and will need to have an upcoming biopsy, tumor excision surgery, or a blood draw or bone marrow aspirate in the case of leukemia or lymphoma to provide tumor tissue for testing.
  * [How do I enroll myself or loved one in one of the ongoing trials?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-3)
If you or a loved one is interested in and qualifies for enrollment in one of our clinical trials, please email fpmlab@fiu.edu.
Currently, only patients treated by one of our participating physicians in the State of Florida can participate in our clinical trials. Please email fpmlab@fiu.edu for the possibility of out-of-state enrollment.
  * [What types of cancers are you focusing on?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-4)
We work on any recurrent or refractory cancer, provided that tumor tissue will be available for testing.
  * [Are the clinical trials only available in Florida? Can I participate if I live in another state?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-5)
Only patients treated by one of our participating physicians in the State of Florida can participate in our clinical trials. Please email fpmlab@fiu.edu for the possibility of out-of-state enrollment.
  * [I am a researcher at another university interested in collaborating. Are there current opportunities?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-6)
If you're interested in collaborating with the Azzam Lab, please email Professor Azzam at dazzam@fiu.edu.
  * [I am a student at FIU interested in research opportunities in the Azzam Lab. How can I find out about current opportunities?](https://stempel.fiu.edu/personalized-cancer-treatment/index.html#panel-N10DDF-7)
If you're an FIU student interested in research opportunities in the Azzam Lab, please email Ebony Coats, laboratory manager, at ecoats@fiu.edu.
