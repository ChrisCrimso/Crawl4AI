Whether you want to manage people, lead a business unit or shape your company's strategy, the management degree will provide you with the solid foundation you need to succeed. Graduates will emerge ready to effectively plan and organize, and fulfill leadership roles. You may choose a general management course of study, or pursue the major with a track in entrepreneurship, green management, leadership or change management.
Graduates with a concentration in management are well prepared to pursue a career as a management analyst, and demand for qualified professionals in this area is expected to grow as organizations seek ways to improve efficiency and control costs.
