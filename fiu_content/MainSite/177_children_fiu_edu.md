# Children's Creative Learning Center
The Children’s Creative Learning Center (CCLC) at FIU is a State Educational Research Center for Child Development and a Cognia Accredited Early Learning School. The Center is a self-supported university auxiliary and a department within the Division of Student Affairs. In addition, the Children’s Center often serves as a demonstration site for university departments and programs in the community through observations, presentations, special programs, training and research.
## Our philosophy
Change and adaptation begin at birth. This never-ending growth pattern is nurtured in a naturally diverse environment at the CCLC. The essence of the program is built around verbal communication, enhancing the children's ability to be in touch with their feelings and to express them verbally. Additionally, the Center's objectives for each child are the development of self-concept and self-reliance, independent decision making, the ability to confront and resolve problems, respect and consideration for others, social skills, and interpersonal relations.
Parent/legal guardian involvement is a high priority at the Center. Parents/legal guardians make a commitment to engage in meaningful experiences with and on behalf of their children thus becoming an integral part of the community. This enriches the children's experience and supports family relationships.

The Center is open to children of FIU students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the neighboring community. Learn how to enroll your child or learn more about our program.
