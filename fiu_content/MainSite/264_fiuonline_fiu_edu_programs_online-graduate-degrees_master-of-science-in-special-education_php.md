  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-graduate-degrees/master-of-science-in-special-education.php)
Our comprehensive master's program prepares teachers for the changing demands of the field, so you can address the unique needs of multicultural students with disabilities. The Master of Science in Special Education helps teachers develop leadership skills for effective supervision, use data to inform and guide classroom instruction and learn about cutting-edge assistive technologies. Special education teachers are the most sought-after professionals in the teaching profession and the prestige of a master's degree can further enhance marketability through advanced training and endorsements. 
**Industry Statistics**
As a special education teacher, you already know that demand for qualified teaching professionals with special education degrees is growing, with many job opportunities requiring a master's degree. The job outlook is especially bright for those special education teachers with specialized training to work with students who have multiple disabilities, severe disabilities, or autism spectrum disorders, ( _Occupational Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics_).
There is a growing demand for special education teachers with the specialized skills to provide services for students on the autism spectrum. According to a 2012 report from the Center for Disease Control, an estimated one in 88 children has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a 78 percent increase since the CDC's first report in 2007. FIU Online's Master of Science in Special Education is one of a select few programs to offer a Florida Autism Endorsement, helping teachers gain expertise in autism — the fastest growing disability area in the U.S. This endorsement is a competitive advantage that opens doors to job opportunities and signals to employers that you have the unique skills to meet the needs of students with autism.
