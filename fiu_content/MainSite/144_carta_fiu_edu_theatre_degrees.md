# BFA PERFORMANCE
The Performance major of our BFA degree is designed to prepare students for a professional theatre career and/or advanced professional theatre training. BFA and BA candidates complete a similar curriculum in the first two years of study. BFA Performance candidates then go on to take advanced courses in theatre performance.
Our commitment to small classes in the BFA Performance program (10-14 students per year) allows for multiple performance opportunities and personalized instruction from our dedicated performance faculty.
## CURRICULUM
Actors develop their own process through in-depth training in various acting, voice, and movement techniques that build upon and complement each other.
BFA Performance students take eight acting classes in their four year plan. The classes cover improvisation, Stanislavski, Meisner, Michael Chekhov, Shakespeare, on-camera acting, audition technique, and solo performance.
In their final semester, students create their senior projects – a 15-minute solo show based on a noteworthy person in history.
The curriculum also includes four voice and movement classes, specializing in Linklater, Masks, and Feldenkrais.

  * #### [BFA Musical Theatre](https://carta.fiu.edu/theatre/degrees/#tab-780b4faa9f1e68e5307)


# BFA MUSICAL THEATRE
The Bachelor of Fine Arts Musical Theatre major is designed to prepare students for professional advanced theatre training and performance careers. We are committed to guiding students to become well-rounded performers in musicals and plays, prepare for today’s professional field, and to use their artistic calling to better their community.
Our holistic Musical Theatre curriculum offers private voice study in every semester of training in addition to essential music-based courses. Our dance courses lay a firm foundation for numerous styles of dance. At the core of our training are first-rate methods in acting, movement, and voice & speech, integrating all aspects of the student’s expression and grounding their work in truth.
Performance opportunities are available in department productions – there are 4 per year on 2 stages – as well as cabarets, special projects, and collaborations with faculty and with area theaters.
## CURRICULUM
In the first two years, the focus is on the fundamentals. Acting 1-4 offers a variety of techniques including Stanislavski, Meisner, and Michael Chekhov. Voice and Movement 1 & 2 focus on freeing the voice and body to communicate with clarity. Applied Voice (private lessons) develops singing technique and musicality, while Fundamentals of Music and Piano provide theory and aural skills. Acting the Song explores vocal styles and storytelling skills. Ballet and Jazz fosters strong dance technique. The curriculum is rounded out with foundational courses that expand the student’s understanding of theatre as a collaborative art.
The last two years focus on advanced training and career preparedness. Musical Theatre Workshop 1 & 2 and Advanced Theatre Studies emphasize building repertoire, audition skills, ensemble work, and scene study. Dance training is further specialized in Tap, Musical Theatre Dance, and Advanced Dance Workshop. Work with Shakespeare and heightened text (in Acting 5) and dialects deepen the students’ range and connection to language. A rich offering of electives, such as Stage Combat, Acting for Film, Dialects, Directing, Playwriting, and Advanced Meisner allow students to develop their individual interests. They prepare to enter the professional market in Career Strategies for Actors. The Senior Project offers students creative space to showcase their skills and unique artistry before graduation.

## ADMISSION INFORMATION FOR TRANSFERS
The BA in Theatre is a versatile and comprehensive liberal arts degree. Students transferring into the BA can usually graduate in three years.
To graduate in a timely manner from FIU with a BA in Theatre, transfer students are encouraged to take foundational courses (when offered) at their Junior College. These foundational courses may include Stagecraft, Costume Technology, Acting I, Acting II, Voice and Movement I, a Technical Theatre Lab, Script Analysis and Playwriting or Stage Makeup. This is a total of nineteen (19) credits. (FIU Theatre acknowledges that most Junior Colleges do not offer many of these classes.)
All transfer students are encouraged to apply early and contact the Theatre department advisor as soon as possible to review their transfer credits and to estimate their graduation date. Timely graduation will be contingent on registering promptly for required courses, passing all classes, and working closely with the theatre advisors and faculty.
