# Accreditation
Florida International University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award associate, baccalaureate, master's, specialist, and doctoral degrees. Florida International University also may offer credentials such as certificates and diplomas at approved degree levels. FIU is reaffirmed every ten years by the SACSCOC. 
The purpose of the site is to serve as a centralized hub to access all of the resources needed to understand FIU’s accreditation process and documentation as laid out by the Office of Academic Planning and Accountability.
The university’s reaffirmation process includes reports demonstrating compliance with the _Principles of Accreditation: Foundations of Quality Enhancement_ set forth by the SACSCOC. 
In addition to the reports, the reaffirmation process includes extensive evaluation of compliance by an off-site peer review committee, an on-site peer review committee, and final review by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees. 
FIU’s Fifth-Year report is due March 15, 2027.
