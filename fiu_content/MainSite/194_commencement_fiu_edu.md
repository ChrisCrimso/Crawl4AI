Registration dates will be announced soon. Please note registration is handled via [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu). Familiarize yourself with [how to register for your commencement ceremony](https://commencement.fiu.edu/getting-ready/registration/index.html).
Commencement ceremonies will take place at the Ocean Bank Convocation Center on our beautiful MMC Campus over the span of five days. Individual ceremonies will be college-specific.
