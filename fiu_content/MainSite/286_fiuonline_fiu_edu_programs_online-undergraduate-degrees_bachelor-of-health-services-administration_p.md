  * ## [ Why Apply? ](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-health-services-administration.php)
A Bachelor in Health Services Administration is a pathway to career advancement and provides an opportunity to make a significant contribution to healthcare organizations and the increasingly multicultural communities in which they serve and work. Job opportunities for graduates with a Bachelor of Health Services Administration (BHSA) degree include management positions in hospitals, long-term care facilities, health insurance, rehabilitation centers, private medical practices, non-profit healthcare, community agencies, and acute care healthcare systems.
The demand for health services and medical managers is expected to grow by 23% between 2012 and 2022. Fueling this growth is the need for managers who can monitor rising healthcare costs, retain employees and recruit new ones, transfer and maintain digital patient records and implement new technologies. Hospitals, which employed 39% of the 315,000 medical and health services managers in 2012, were the top employer, but there are new opportunities in nursing care facilities and offices of healthcare practitioners and medical group practices. _(Occupational Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics)_
