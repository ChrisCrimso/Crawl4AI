Current Interests: 
1. Bacteriophages isolated from soil using hosts found in soil:SEA PHAGES (HHMI) 
2. The Arginine Effect. And, assay of quorum sensing inhibitors, synthetic and those in Ginseng ([Link to Recent Poster Presentations](http://www.fiu.edu/%7Emakemson/PosterPresentations/)). Quorum sensing and molecular aspects of luciferase in _Shewanella_ , _Photobacterium_ and _Vibrio_.  Arginine was the first molecule discovered to induce luciferase synthesis (Coffee, 1967). Nealson, Platt and Hastings (1970) showed, in a landmark paper, that the arginine effect was only operative during "Autoinduction" of luciferase synthesis. Today, autoinduction is called "Quorum Sensing" which in _Vibrio harveyi_ is the integration of three autoinducers (produced by the bacteria themselves) through a complex phoshorylation cascade that includes small regulatory RNA's at _Lux R_ the master regulator of the luciferase operon (lux) and many other genes (beautiful work from the Bassler lab). We are interested in how arginine, one of the common 20 amino acids, is able to stimulate luciferase synthesis in this system as well as the other words of the luminous bacterial communication system.

The lab is equiped with photometers (some home built), spectrophotometers, luminescence imaging (chilled CCD), PCR thermalcycler, Agarose Electrophoresis and PAGE, incubators, Luciferase assay photometer, and other biochemical/microbiologcial equipment. Weekly lab meeting: discussion of ancient to recent papers on bacterial bioluminescence.
