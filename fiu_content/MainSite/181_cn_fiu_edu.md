# PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience
Our Doctor of Philosophy in Cognitive Neuroscience trains students to become experts in the study of the neuroscience of cognition and behavior. Students explore the neurobiology of cognition with developmental, cognitive and clinical neuroscience researchers in the areas of sensorimotor behavior and perception, language, memory, executive function and substance abuse.
Our program offers comprehensive training from an internationally recognized faculty. The rigorous academic program prepares students for research careers at research institutes, at public and private universities, or in non-academic settings.
We maintain a strong emphasis on learning basic neuroanatomy and physiology, cognitive neuroscience research methodologies (including MRI, TMS, EEG and other electrophysiological measures), and analytic skills and neural bases of psychology and psychopathology.
