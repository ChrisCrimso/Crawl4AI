The University is committed to providing options through multiple contact points across campus that are broadly accessible to all University community members to address a potential violation of FIU-105 Regulation. Anyone may seek confidential assistance and/or make a report to the University on behalf of themselves or others. Confidential assistance means speaking about the alleged violation with a professional who cannot share the information with anyone else without the express permission from the person sharing the information unless there is a threat of serious harm to the person sharing the information and/or to others and/or there is a legal obligation to reveal such information (e.g., suspected abuse or neglect of a minor or vulnerable adult).
