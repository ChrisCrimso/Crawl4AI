The Education Effect aligns university expertise, resources, and research-based intervention programs focused on youth development, family involvement, teacher professional development, and community engagement. The strategic partnership addresses pressing educational and social needs of students from elementary through high school and beyond. The partnership is designed to impact “whole child, whole school, and whole community” through strategic collaborations that increase the collective capacity for all children to succeed and thrive in education. The Education Effect serves as a solution to an ever changing educational landscape by utilizing the knowledge of students, teachers, families, and communities to provide an opportunity to educate, empower and exchange ideas, assist people to understand problems, and become assets for change.
The Education Effect raises the platform by supporting and challenging students to acquire the knowledge, skills, and attributes needed to effectively achieve in school, graduate high school, and to enroll for success in postsecondary education. It supports the individual needs of students’ as they reach and grow to their full potential by infusing extra people and a culture of high expectations. The partnership is mutually beneficial to a broadening P-20 system, impacting preschool through feeder pattern schools (elementary, middle school and high school) and postsecondary institutions. The Education Effect reflects FIU’s dedication to serve as a solutions center for the urban core and the Greater Miami community by working collectively with students, parents, teachers, and stakeholders to increase postsecondary completion, particularly among students currently under-represented in higher education.
The multidisciplinary approach of the partnership is based on a comprehensive needs assessment of community stakeholders and community assets that are mutually beneficial to all. The partnership’s primary goals are:
  * Support student success and positive pathways
  * School improvement
  * Family involvement and community engagement
  * Strategic collaborations and partnerships for positive outcomes
