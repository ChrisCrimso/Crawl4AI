# Dean of Students
A part of Student Health & Wellness, the Dean of Students office identifies and addresses student concerns and crises. Some students will face obstacles along the path toward their academic goals, such as personal distress, anxiety, depression, family emergencies, health issues and more. There are excellent support services on campus to assist students, with the purpose of getting them back on track toward their goals. Through the _Panthers Care_ initiative, the Dean of Students office can assist students one-on-one by identifying the appropriate campus resources to best help them.
Services offered include:
  * [**An online referral system**](https://report.fiu.edu/) for faculty, staff, and students to help identify students in distress.
  * **Outreach to students** who self-identify or are identified by others as needing additional support.
  * **Oversee the Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT),** a committee of campus partners that help in identifying and responding to students who may be at risk of harming themselves or others, or who may reasonably pose a threat to the safety and well-being of the campus community.
  * **Education for the FIU community** about bystander intervention, interpersonal violence prevention, and identifying students in distress.
  * [**A network of campus resources**](https://dasa.fiu.edu/student-support/wellness/index.html) that are available to assist and support students.
