#  Contact Advising
College life can be difficult. There’s so much you need to do that it’s easy to get overwhelmed.
But you don’t have to go through it alone. Every student, especially if you’re struggling, should seek help from an advisor or a college life coach. They can help you overcome personal and academic issues that get in the way of your education.
## Mission Statement
Academic advising at FIU empowers students to gain and expand their knowledge and pursue opportunities to achieve academic, personal, and professional goals.
As advocates for student learning and success, academic advisors partner with students to promote their holistic development, identify academic and career resources, and encourage meaningful engagement, while educating them on degree requirements to support their persistence and timely graduation.
## Academic Advising 
Every degree seeking undergraduate student has an assigned Academic Advisor in their major. Students can contact their advisor via their [Panther Success Network (PSN)](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/advising/panther-success-hub/panther-success-network/highpoint-manuals/psn_studentmanual_march28_pdf-1.pdf "URL to PSN Student Manual"). You should **see your advisor at least once a semester.** They are your best source of information when making academic decisions. Advisors are especially busy when the class enrollment period begins, so make an appointment early in the semester.
## University Core Curriculum (UCC)
Any student entering Florida International University as a first-time college student (Summer 2003 or after) or transferring in without an Associates in Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public institution (Fall 2003 or after) is required to fulfill the University Core Curriculum requirements.
The University Core Curriculum (UCC) is a broad, well-defined curriculum that helps students to think critically, analytically, and creatively. It encourages a passion to learn, and provides them with the skills and abilities to organize, assemble, assess, and incorporate new knowledge and information.
The UCC rests upon the belief that a foundational curriculum, shared by students, fosters intellectual development and enhances personal, social, intellectual, and academic relations. Together with concentration in a major field of study, the UCC builds the base that makes future academic and professional excellence possible.
FlU’s UCC requires courses in six fundamental areas of knowledge and FIU’s First-Year Experience course. Some of these requirements are sequential; others have pre-requisites. All UCC courses are listed on the check off sheet and only the exact courses listed in each category will fulfill your general education requirements. Other important notes are included at the end of the sheet. Make certain to read the UCC sheet completely. Students are ultimately responsible to meet with an advisor to plan course schedules and review important academic policies and procedures.
