# SAS Support Your Mission
The Office of Student Access & Success (SAS) is dedicated to providing access to high quality education for academically talented underrepresented students. SAS is focused on removing barriers that impede degree completion and improving students’ learning outcomes and academic success through strategically impactful programming and services. We are also committed to increasing degree completion at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This initiative will assist students who experience financial and other crises that impact their academic progress or retention at FIU, in addition to supporting the general outreach and developmental needs of SAS. The intent is also to support more discretionary SAS activities, including leadership attendance at community events. Funding student participation in leadership development summits, engaging community partners in our student access initiative, assisting students who encounter unexpected financial hardships.
> The McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program helped me get real hands-on experience in a research lab. During this program’s summer research appointment, I was able to partake in a scientific project and present my findings in a conference setting. This program not only gave me the tools to be a better scientist, but also prepared me for graduate school with professional workshops and GRE assistance. During my graduate career, with the assistance of the Office of Student Access & Success, I was able to pursue dual degrees in Forensic Science (M.S.) and Biological Sciences (Ph.D.) through the McNair Graduate Fellowship. With their assistance, I was able to be funded for two years which allowed me to dedicate my time solely on my academics and research.Natalie Damaso ’11, ’13
> With courage, motivation, and support, nothing is impossible. These three things are what made me a Golden Scholar. Falling and getting right back up is a way of learning. Through support from the Office of Student Access & Success, I have learned to strive to my fullest potential and to seek things that once scared me. As I continue to grow, I learn more and more about myself and my confidence helps me to become successful. I am not only an FIU student, I am a Golden Scholar.Naidy Escobar
> I applied to the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program because their goal is to prepare undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented groups for doctoral studies. As a first generation Mexican-American college student, who dreamed of becoming a researcher, I valued the immense and incomparable academic, moral, and social support I obtained as a McNair Scholar. Even further, I am pleased to say that I am an incoming Psychology PhD student at FIU and this would not have been possible without the McNair program through the Office of Student Access & Success. I am truly proud to call myself a McNair Fellow.Yanet Ruvalcaba ’16
