Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom and achievement, while encouraging continuous self-development. As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida.
The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm.
