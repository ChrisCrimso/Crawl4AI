# Faculty and Staff Accommodations
FIU has a long-standing policy of employing qualified persons with disabilities in a broad range of positions across the institution. On occasion, the nature of an individual’s disability may require them to receive a work-site accommodation. The Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA) serves as a resource for employees who have documented a qualified disability and need reasonable accommodations to perform essential job functions.
![convocation flame being transferred to Ernesto](https://ace.fiu.edu/ada-and-accessibility/52908067310_0bcaae7de1_o-1.jpg)
Employees should direct their requests for accommodations to CRCA. Employees who wish to request accommodations for a disability must submit the following forms along with supporting documentation to CRCA:
  * General Employee Accommodations 
    * [Physician Verification of Accommodation Form](https://ace.fiu.edu/_assets/docs/physician-verification-of-accommodation-form.pdf)(The employee’s approved job description must be submitted to, and reviewed by the physician or health care provider at the time the physician verification form is completed by the physician or health care provider. The approved job description can be requested through CRCA.)
  * University Event Accommodations
