## FIU Statement
Florida International University is committed to ensuring equal access to educational and employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Florida Education Equity Act, as well as other applicable laws and University policy. Under the ADA, qualified individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination and may be entitled to reasonable accommodations.
[View our Reasonable Accommodations Policy for Faculty, Staff, and Employment Applicants/Candidates](https://policies.fiu.edu/files/872.pdf)
> Florida International University values a diverse and inclusive community and recognizes the responsibility to provide equitable access to courses and campuses. While we are committed to ensuring adherence to various federal, state and local laws and university policy [the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973], this work started prior to the launch of the accessibility project and has been woven into the fabric of who we are as a university — truth, freedom, respect, responsibility and excellence. We are excited to continue this work and are grateful that you are on this journey with us.
> —Nicole Attong, Interim ADA and Accessibility Coordinator
## Accommodation vs. Accessibility
**Accommodation** refers to any change in the work environment or standard practice that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal opportunities. They are applied retroactively to overcome barriers in the environment or system.
**Accessibility** refers to ensuring that individuals with disabilities are afforded the opportunity to have access to information, services, and environments in an effective and integrative manner. It focuses on proactively integrating universal design principles from the start to ensure access and usability for everyone.
> I wish for a world that views disability, mental or physical, not as a hindrance but as unique attributes that can be seen as powerful assets if given the right opportunities.
> —Oliver Sacks, MD, neurologist and writer
