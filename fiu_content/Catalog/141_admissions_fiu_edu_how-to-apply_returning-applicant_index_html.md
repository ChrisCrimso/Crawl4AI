# Returning Applicants
We’re glad you’re coming back to finish your degree. A returning student is anyone who was previously admitted to FIU as a degree-seeking student for at least 1 term or more of coursework and is now returning to complete their first bachelor’s degree.
Apply as a returning student if you meet the following criteria:
  * You were previously enrolled at FIU as a degree-seeking student but did not complete your degree.
  * You have not completed a bachelor’s degree elsewhere since leaving FIU.
  * You have not enrolled in any coursework at FIU for at least 3 or more consecutive terms (excluding military withdrawals) and as a result, have been discontinued from the university.


## Important Dates
Application Deadlines| **Application**| **College of Business****Application**  
---|---|---  
**Spring 2025**|  December 2| November 8  
**Summer A/C 2025**|  March 11| March 4

## How to Apply
Returning students must meet the current university and degree-specific requirements to be admitted. Search [Degrees & Programs](https://www.fiu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs/index.html) for requirements. [Specialized Admissions programs](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/) require more competitive criteria than others.
Apply using the undergraduate application and select “Readmit” under admit type on your application. You do not need to submit your transcript again as long as it hasn’t changed since you first applied to FIU. You must submit new transcripts if you/ve attended any post-secondary institutions since leaving FIU.

## Returning after Academic Dismissal
FIU has the following policies for students who left FIU with a GPA below 2.0 or were academically dismissed from the university.
All former FIU students requesting academic Salvage/Amnesty must first reapply for admission via the online admission application. If you believe you qualify for academic salvage or academic amnesty when you submit your application for admission you may select one policy as an option.
### Academic Amnesty Policy
Academic amnesty helps returning students get a fresh start. Students who left FIU with a GPA below 2.0 or were academically dismissed from the university and have not enrolled in any university or college for at least 5 calendar years can apply for academic amnesty.
If readmitted, students will begin with a 0.0 GPA. However, credit from previous university courses, in which a grade "C" or better was earned may be applied towards a degree (subject to determination by the college of the student's major). All prior courses attempted and grade received will be on the student's transcript. Students applying to a [Specialized Admissions program](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/) must meet the admission criteria of the program. Admitted students may not petition for any retroactive change on their academic record.
Link to the policies:  _**<https://policies.fiu.edu/files/925.pdf>**_
### Academic Salvage Policy
Academic salvage helps students who went back to college for their AA. Students who left FIU with a GPA below 2.0 or were academically dismissed from the university and who have received an associate of arts (AA) degree from another Florida public institution can apply for academic salvage.
If readmitted, students will begin with a new FIU GPA of 0.0 and will be credited with a maximum of 60 semester credit hours. Students must follow the regular readmission application process and complete the salvage form for consideration to be determined by the student's academic dean.
Link to the policies:  _**<https://policies.fiu.edu/files/719.pdf>**_
**_Credits earned prior to readmission under academic amnesty or salvage are not applicable in computing the FIU 40-credit-requirement grade points to graduate with honors._**
