## Carla Sofia Avila
Carla Sofia Avila has a bachelor's degree in digital arts and graphic design, and you may have noticed she's in a wheelchair. **But don't label her.**
Her wheelchair has allowed her to explore the world and be involved as a student leader and a friend. She's here to redefine disability.
## Professor Robert Jaross
Professor Jaross believes **all students should feel welcome** in class—that's why he doesn't wait for his students to tell him his course materials aren't accessible. Instead, he uses universal design concepts to ensure his course materials and activities are available to all students regardless of the challenges they may face.

Whatever our individual roles at FIU, an important part of our collective mission is facilitating learning for all students of all backgrounds, interests and abilities. The Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA) also serves as a main resource for employees who have documented a qualified disability and need reasonable accommodations to perform essential job functions.
