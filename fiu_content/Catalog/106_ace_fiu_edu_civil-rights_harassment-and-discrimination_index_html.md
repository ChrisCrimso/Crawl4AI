## Equal Opportunity Policy Statement
![regan-students.jpg](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/harassment-and-discrimination/regan-students3.jpg)
Florida International University is firmly committed to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and to compliance with all federal, state, local laws, and University policies that prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, genetic information (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions), national origin, disability, or veteran status and other protected classifications. This policy applies to all employment decisions including, but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, training, promotions, pay practices, benefits, disciplinary actions and terminations. 
As a federal contractor, Florida International University is also committed to taking affirmative action for veterans and individuals with disabilities.
We invite employees who are disabled or protected veterans to self-identify as such with the EEO Coordinator. This self-identification is strictly voluntary and confidential and will not result in retaliation of any sort. 
Employees of and applicants to Florida International University will not be subject to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination because they have engaged or may engage in filing a complaint, assisting in a review, investigation, or hearing or have otherwise sought to obtain their legal rights related to any federal, state, or local law regarding EEO for qualified individuals with disabilities or qualified protected veterans. 
At Florida International University, we are committed to the principles of non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity. In order to ensure dissemination and implementation of equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination throughout all levels of the University, **Emmanuele Bowles** has been appointed as the _EEO Coordinator_ for Florida International University. One of the EEO Coordinator’s duties is to establish and maintain an internal audit and reporting system to allow for effective measurement of the University’ programs. 
In furtherance of Florida International University’s policy regarding non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity, FIU takes affirmative action for veterans and individuals with disabilities, and sets forth the policies, practices, and procedures which the University is committed to applying in order to ensure that its policy align with federal and state guidelines. This Affirmative Action Program for qualified individuals with disabilities and qualified protected veterans is available for inspection by any employee or applicant for employment upon request, between 9:00 – 5:00 at the Department of Access, Compliance, and Equal Opportunity in Primera Casa (PC) 220. **Any questions should be directed to your supervisor or Emmanuele Bowles, EEO Coordinator, ace@fiu.edu.**
