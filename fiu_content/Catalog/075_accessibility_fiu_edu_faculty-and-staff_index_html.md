# Faculty & Staff
## Message for faculty and staff
Whatever our individual roles at FIU, an important part of our collective mission is facilitating learning for all students of all backgrounds, interests and abilities. As faculty and staff we all play a role in ensuring that FIU is an inclusive place of learning, where no student is left out of opportunities to thrive because they are not accessible to them.
In this website, you will find information regarding accommodation requests and resources to increase accessibility of your documents, courses and programs. Our goal, is to incorporate universal design – incorporating elements that are necessary for some and good for all - into everything we do so that there is less need for individual accommodation.
Employees who wish to request accommodations for a disability must submit the following forms along with supporting documentation to CRCA:
  * General Employee Accommodations 
    * [Physician Verification of Accommodation Form](https://ace.fiu.edu/_assets/docs/physician-verification-of-accommodation-form.pdf)(The employee’s approved job description must be submitted to, and reviewed by the physician or health care provider at the time the physician verification form is completed by the physician or health care provider. The approved job description can be requested through CRCA.)
  * University Event Accommodations

# Reasonable Accommodations Policy for Events
**Similarly to displaying critical event information such as dates, times and locations, the[reasonable accommodation language](https://ace.fiu.edu/resources/general-resources/2025-language-for-fiu-events.pdf) below must be included in all event website and promotions materials: **
Should you need an ADA accommodation to participate in a university event, program, or activity or need to request materials in an accessible format, please contact FIU’s Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA) at 305-348-2785 or .

## Have a concern?
If any student, employee or applicant has a good faith belief that they have been discriminated against or harassed based on age, color, disability, marital status, ethnic or national origin, race, religion, retaliation, sex or any other protected category, CRCA encourages them to report the incident.
