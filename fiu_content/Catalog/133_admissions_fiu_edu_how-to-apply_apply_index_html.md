# Apply
As you prepare to apply to FIU, be aware that some programs may require additional documents or secondary applications in addition to your university application. To ensure you meet all the admissions requirements, please review our application checklist.
The application process is the same whether you apply to learn on-campus or fully online. Follow application instructions or get help from an admissions counselor.
In response to the [Chancellor of the Florida Board of Governors Emergency Order 2024-E0-01,](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BOG-EO-24-01.pdf) Florida International University is working to remove barriers for those students seeking to transfer to a Florida university because of a well-founded fear of discrimination, harassment, intimidation or violence at an out-of-state, degree-granting, accredited institution within the United States. To ensure adherence to the order, if you are an applicant intending to undertake academic studies within FIU, please complete our [online form](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=4438092) and one of our Admissions staff will contact you regarding next steps.
