# Student Experiences
The department of Student Experiences aspires to engage students in holistic learning by instilling diversity, leadership, and personal development through its programs and services. By educating and mentoring students, Student Experiences seeks to provide our students with an opportunity to make meaningful connections and become leaders in a global community. Student Experiences is responsible for the advisement of the following councils; Black Student Union, Homecoming, International Student Union, Panther Power, Registered Student Organizations Council, and Student Programming Councils at MMC and BBC. 
## Involvement for all
**Being involved means being a part of something you really care about!**
Student Experience’s **Involvement for All** section will allow you to request an Involvement Consultation or browse through our agencies/bureaus and organizations to find the right fit for you. From school spirit to event planning and community advocacy, our organizations are sure to enhance your FIU experience so that you make the most out of college. All registered student organizations are open to all current FIU students.

## Programs and Events
In addition to advising student councils, Student Experiences also oversees campus wide programs for students.
### **FIU in DC Fly In**
Student Experiences in partnership with the FIU in DC Office created and organized a three-day, fast-paced dynamic learning experience for World’s Ahead DC Fly In students twice a year. Each semester (Fall and Spring) – 10- 15 students will travel to DC to experience think tanks, meet with representatives of the Senate and House, interview at possible internship sites, as well as learn about advocacy and communications. This program is to help students learn more about DC and the FIU in DC Office as well as learn about the endless possibilities DC has to offer.
### Grad Fest
Grad Fest is an annual event hosted each spring semester to celebrate graduating Panthers (Undergraduate, Graduate, and Professional). Students can decorate graduation caps, get photos with a professional photographer, enjoy some tasty treats, and more.
### Life Skills Series
The Life Skills Series is a program consisting of workshops on various skills and subject matter that will help to prepare the student for life during and after college. Topics range from things like time management and financial literacy to more hands on skills like how to tie a tie or cook a simple meal. Workshops are offered throughout the year as in-person, virtual, and/or hybrid programs.
### Love Your Major Fair
This fair, hosted each Fall semester, allows you to ask questions about your major, interact with advisors, faculty, and peers, explore majors and areas of interest, and build a stronger connection with your major and academic department.
### Panther Connections Panels
Panther Connections Panels are organized by track into 3 sessions each fall and spring semester:
  * Global & Social Sciences and Humanities & Arts
  * Biological & Environmental Sciences and Health Sciences
  * Administration & Management and Physical Sciences & Engineering


Students listen to, and potentially meet with, professionals in the field during the scheduled networking time at the end. The hope is that students will find their passion area and major of study through participating. Panelists may answer questions related to their undergraduate status as an undecided student, if their major is related to their career, obstacles they may have faced, and advice they would like to share with students.
### Week of Welcome
Week of Welcome is a series of events during the first week of the fall and spring semesters that provides students with opportunities to engage with Student Experiences and the various student agencies and bureaus. There are opportunities to receive helpful information and resources, attend student-run events, and experience college life outside of the classroom.
## Hazing
Hazing is a violation of the FIU Student Code of Conduct. Hazing is defined as any group or individual action or activity that inflicts or intends to inflict physical or mental harm or discomfort or which may demean, disgrace, or degrade any person, regardless of location, intent, or consent of participant(s). Hazing includes, but is not limited to, forced consumption of any food, alcohol, controlled substances, drugs, or any other substance, forced physical activity, deprivation of food or sleep, physical abuse of any nature, and verbal abuse, including yelling or demands.
