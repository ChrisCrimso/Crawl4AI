[Theatre](https://carta.fiu.edu/theatre/academics/undergraduate/advising/)
#### [When should I see my academic advisor?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#16c1a10fb6416e12c)
We want to help you be successful in your academic career. Proactive decision-making and effective planning will help you reach your goals. See your advisor at least once a semester to be sure you’re on track for your degree.
#### [How do I schedule an appointment?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#50f573f1afa586a3c)
Just email or give us a call using the contact information found in the “Who is my academic advisor and how do I contact them?” section above.
#### [Can’t I just walk in? Do I have to make an appointment?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#1266fe0de9e8924d5)
You can pop in, but if you have more than a question or two, it’s best to make an appointment so we’re sure we have enough time to help you. Walk-ins may involve a wait, but if you’re prepared for that, stop by and see us.
#### [I’m a new student. What do I need to do to get started?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#563aded8df4812644)
Welcome! Once you’re admitted, [register for Orientation](http://orientation.fiu.edu/?page_id=101). You’ll meet with an advisor at Orientation who will go over program requirements and help you choose your courses.
#### [When should I complete my University Core Curriculum (UCC) courses?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#a7f6b6b0f6e7ec232)
All University Core Curriculum requirements should be completed in your first two years. If you transfer in with an Associate of Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public college or university, you will have fulfilled the core.
#### [How do I calculate my Grade Point Average?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#c04b4b8944c2841d1)
There are two types of GPAs: Semester and Cumulative. The semester GPA is calculated using the courses taken in that semester. The cumulative GPA is a summary of all FIU courses taken in your academic career.
To calculate a GPA, first multiply the number of course credits/semester hours for each course by the grade point values associated with the grade received in that course. Then add all of those totals together and divide that sum by the total number of course credits/semester hours.
For a semester GPA, use all regularly graded courses in that semester (plus P/F courses in which an F or U was earned), and for the cumulative GPA use all courses. Do not average semester GPAs in order to calculate the cumulative GPA.
_Example:_
**Course**| **Grade**| **Course Credits Attempted**| **Points per Credit Hour**| **Points per Course**  
---|---|---|---|---  
ENC 1101| B| 3.0 x| 3.00 =| 9.00  
MAC 2147| B+| 4.0 x| 3.33 =| 13.32  
BSC 1010| A-| 3.0 x| 3.67 =| 11.01  
BSC 1010L| A| 1.0 x| 4.00 =| 4.00  
AMH 2041| C| 3.0 x| 2.00 =| 6.00  
ARH 2050| F| 3.0 x| 0.00 =| 0.00  
**Total**| | **17**| | **43.33**  
#### [ What is the difference between a major and a minor?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#2005f61ff6676c98b)
A major is a main area of study that requires 30 – 60 credits of upper division coursework, while a minor is an area of interest or specialization that consists of approximately 15 – 18 credits.
To graduate, you must be fully admitted to a major in one of our [colleges or schools](http://www.fiu.edu/academics/colleges-schools/index.html). Double majoring is an option only if you’re earning a bachelor’s degree.
Minors are associated with bachelor’s degrees. However, students seeking a master’s degree have the option to pursue a Graduate Certificate.
#### [What is a prerequisite and why do I need it?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#37bfc5ee07df54bac)
A prerequisite is a course that must be completed prior to the course in question. Prerequisite courses are important to develop a strong foundation in a content area before going on to the next course. You can find prerequisites in the [course catalog](http://onlineapps.fiu.edu/coursecatalog/).
Graduate students have two types of prerequisite classes. You might have to take undergraduate courses for a graduate program. You might also need to take graduate-level courses to be admitted to certain graduate programs.
#### [What is a co-requisite?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#8597b874c3330cd3b)
A co-requisite is one that must be taken at the same time as another course.
#### [How do I know what courses I need to take?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#b407c631162f1fe0d)
Refer to your Panther Degree Audit (PDA) and the [course catalog](http://catalog.fiu.edu/) for degree requirements and your progress. If you do not have a copy of your curriculum sheet, contact your academic advisor for assistance. The CARTA Student Services and Advising Center can be reached at 305-348-2765.
#### [I tried to register, but I have a hold. Why?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#445d66ec7ab4e1fcb)
There can be a number of reasons for a hold – missing documentation, an outstanding balance or an issue with your academic status. To review your holds, go to [MyFIU.](http://my.fiu.edu/)
#### [How do I apply for graduation?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#01ba51cbd087ef520)
  1. Find the dates for applying on the [Academic Calendar](http://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/).
  2. Login to [MyFIU](http://my.fiu.edu/) and select “Self-Service.”
  3. Click “Degree Progress to Graduation.”
  4. Click “Apply for Graduation.”
  5. Follow the prompts to complete the application.


Bachelor degree applicants may be selected to complete the Senior Assessment. This survey is used to measure the effect of FIU’s efforts to support your success.
#### [How do I declare Architecture, Interior Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Music, or Theatre as a major?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#39003a48079fbf10a)
Since these program enrollments are limited, you must be recommended for admission by the respective department in order to declare either as a major. Visit [Future Students](http://www.fiu.edu/future-students/index.html) for information on the application process.
#### [How many transfer credits are applied toward graduation?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#a0f34d99e14a9be6f)
A total of 60 credits are applied toward graduation regardless of how many credits you’ve completed prior to acceptance to the university.
#### [If I’m in a design program, can I switch to another program?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#2f1d168d746c32628)
In order to change your major from one design program to another, you must submit a portfolio during the admission review period (Deadline: Feb 1). The department will let you know if you’re selected. You will also need to meet with an academic advisor to complete a Change of Major form.
#### [When do Accelerated students transition from undergraduate to graduate?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#2c346abd22720e08c)
At the end of the spring semester of the fourth year, students are evaluated for transition to graduate standing. In order to transition, the following criteria must be satisfied:
  * A minimum of 120 earned credits (counting no more than 60 lower-division transfer credits)
  * 3.0 or higher cumulative GPA in graduate level coursework (5000 level or higher)
  * Completion of general education/prerequisite coursework.


#### [What’s the difference between the Accelerated Master and the Master of Arts degree?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#046f454321667e87f)
The Accelerated Master of Architecture, Interior Architecture, or Landscape Architecture is for students who have recently graduated from high school and those who have an Associate in Arts (AA) degree with the required prerequisite coursework for design.
The Master of Arts in Architecture, Interior Architecture, or Landscape Architecture is a post-professional degree for students with an accredited professional degree in the respective design discipline.
Contact the Recruiter for the School of Architecture at 305-348-2765 with additional questions.
#### [What is the difference between undergraduate and graduate courses?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#7c45ec3e1e382161f)
Undergraduate courses have course numbers from 1xxx to 4xxx. These courses are generally applied toward an Associate or Bachelors degree. Graduate courses have course numbers that are 5xxx and above. These courses are generally applied toward the completion of a Masters or Doctoral program.
There is also a difference in [tuition cost](http://onestop.fiu.edu/financial-aid/tuition-and-fees/) per credit for Undergraduate and Graduate coursework.
#### [What happens if I do not complete the first two years of coursework within the Accelerated program?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#17e9ba214865823ce)
If you don’t complete the pre-graduate curriculum by the end of the summer of your second year in the accelerated program, you’ll be delayed in moving forward to graduate coursework. You then must complete the pre-graduate coursework while waiting a year to continue the studio sequence. Your graduate coursework will continue the following fall semester.
#### [What are Transfer Differential Credits?](https://carta.fiu.edu/students/undergraduate/frequently-asked-questions/#c4203d7065ff398a2)
These are the difference in credits between the 60 transfer credits accepted by the university and the 73 credits that native students (students who began their academic career at FIU) have completed within their first two years of study.
