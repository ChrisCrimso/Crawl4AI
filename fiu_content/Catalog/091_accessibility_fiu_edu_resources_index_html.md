## Forms
Reasonable accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis and are based on the documentation provided. The university’s ADA and Accessibility Coordinator will meet individually with the employee who is seeking accommodations to discuss needs and options. Once all required documentation has been submitted, verified, and reviewed, CRCA will coordinate efforts with the appropriate parties to ensure the approved accommodation is provided to the employee.
