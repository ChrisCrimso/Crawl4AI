Many Federal and State laws along with FIU policies impact the work and operations of our University. These laws and policies inform the University's non-discrimination and equal opportunity efforts, as well as provide protection from retaliation for those who speak up with a sincere and reasonable belief that they have been unfairly treated. These laws and policies are enforced by Federal agencies such as the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program (OFCCP), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as FIU's Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA). See further below for a list of applicable laws and policies. 
# Notice of Non-Discrimination
Federal law requires that the following statement be included in all job postings:
**_FIU is a State University System of Florida member, Equal Opportunity, Equal Access, and Affirmative Action Employer for individuals with disabilities and veterans. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment decisions, programs, and events without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, or protected veteran status. For inquiries regarding non-discrimination, contact FIU's Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility at 305.348.2785 or email ocrca@fiu.edu._**
#  Reasonable Accommodation Statement
Federal law requires that the following statement be included in all promotional materials for University events and programs, and must be displayed in much the same way as you would the location, date and time of an event or program. 
 _**Should you need an ADA accommodation to participate in a University event, program, or activity or need to request materials in an accessible format, please contact FIU's Office of Civil Rights Compliance and Accessibility (CRCA) at 305-348-2785 or . All requests for ADA accommodation or accessible materials for this event must be submitted to CRCA at least seven (7) business days prior to the event or at the earliest possible opportunity.** _
