# FIU-107: Intimate Relations
FIU's new Intimate Relationships Regulation, [FIU-107](https://regulations.fiu.edu/docs=276), prohibits and addresses workplace relationships involving employees with authority. It specifically focuses on romantic, intimate, or dating relationships where an employee holds supervisory, evaluative, or advisory duties over another University community member. Those participating in existing relationships that fall within the scope of this regulation must disclose their status to the Office of Employee and Labor Relations (ELR) by logging on to: <https://myhr.fiu.edu>, using the “Employee” tab, to disclose your relationship(s). 
FIU's policy on [Intimate Relationships](https://regulations.fiu.edu/regulation=FIU-107) is linked in the University’s policy library.
Please find the resourced below for additional information relating to the policy, process, and requirements.
**Frequently Asked Questions**
  * [1. What is an Intimate Relationship, as defined by this Regulation?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-1)
An Intimate Relationship is any relationship that can be reasonably described as sexual, romantic, amorous, or dating in nature or the pursuit of any such relationship. Physical contact is not a required element of an Intimate Relationship. Additionally, an Intimate Relationship may exist on the basis of a single interaction.
  * [2. Is the University's intent to eliminate all intimate relationships?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-2)
No. The University's intent is to prohibit **Intimate Relationships where one employee exercises authority over another University Community Member**. This includes Intimate Relationships occurring between an Employee with Authority with any University community member that they have authority over.
  * [3. What is an Employee with Authority?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-3)
An Employee with Authority is any employee who instructs, hires, fires, oversees, directs, coaches, trains, counsels, supervises, or evaluates another University Community Member, directly, indirectly, or functionally. An “Employee with Authority” is someone who has the authority to influence the career, academics, educational activities, or employment status of another University Community member.
Examples of possible Employees with Authority include employees that are instructors, oﬃcers, coaches, supervisors, managers, administrators, directors, principal investigators, advisors, residential life staff, physicians, deans, chairs, and faculty.
  * [4. What happens if two individuals have decided to date but have not yet entered into a committed relationship?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-4)
A dating relationship is considered an Intimate Relationship under this Regulation and must be reported if one individual in the relationship is an Employee with Authority over the other.
  * [5. Do I need to disclose under the Intimate Relations Regulation if I have already disclosed under the Nepotism Policy?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-5)
The answer depends on the nature of the relationship, including whether it meets the definition of “Intimate Relationship” and involves an “Employee with Authority” over the other. You must disclose under the Intimate Relations Regulation if you are engaged in an Intimate Relationship with another University Community Member and are an Employee with Authority over that University Community Member. In some instances, if an employee has already filed a disclosure pursuant to the Nepotism Policy, issues relating to authority may have already been resolved.
Employees should be aware that a change in employment or academic circumstances, such as promotion, restructuring, or a change in a student’s academic focus, may implicate a relationship prohibited by this Regulation. Should such a change cause a pre-existing relationship to conflict with this Regulation, the Employee with Authority must immediately disclose the relationship to and seek guidance from the Office of Employee and Labor Relations.
  * [6. How do I disclose an Intimate Relationship?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-6)
By contacting the Office of Employee and Labor Relations (ELR).
  * [7. What if I have knowledge of such a relationship that has not been reported?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-7)
Violations of this Regulation should be reported directly to the Office of Employee and Labor Relations (ELR), or through the [Ethical Panther Hotline](https://compliance.fiu.edu/hotline/), which allows for the option of submitting a confidential report, by visiting **or by calling 1-888-520-0570 (24 hours a day, 365 days a year).**
Retaliation against the reporting individual is expressly prohibited and the University will take immediate and responsive action to any report of retaliation. No University employee shall retaliate against any person who in good faith reports or assists in reporting a potential violation of this Regulation or participates in an investigation or resolution pursuant to this Regulation. Any attempt to penalize anyone involved in the process through any form of retaliation shall be treated as a separate violation.
  * [8. Does exercise of authority for academic oversight only involve teaching, grading, and mentoring?](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N101BB-8)
No, exercise of authority includes any influence on academic standing and progress. For example, voting to confer a degree upon a graduate student would constitute exercise of authority.


**Scenarios**
  * [ Scenario A](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N103A6-1)
  * [Scenario B](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N103A6-2)
  * [Scenario C](https://ace.fiu.edu/civil-rights/intimate-relations/index.html#panel-N103A6-3)


**Scenario A: A couple is initially hired into different departments within the same college. Later, one becomes the Dean of the college. What would happen under the Nepotism Policy? What about the Intimate Relations Regulation?**
**Nepotism Policy: MUST DISCLOSE IMMEDIATELY**
The initial hire of the couple must be disclosed pursuant to the University’s Nepotism Policy and, because it is occurring within the same college, must be approved by the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources.
Please note: This question assumes the employees are both out of unit and the CBA does not apply.
**Intimate Relations Regulation: MUST DISCLOSE AT TIME EMPLOYEE PROMOTED TO DEAN**
The initial hire of the couple would not violate the Intimate Relations Regulation nor would it require disclosure, as there would be no exercise of authority between the two until one is appointed Dean. Assuming that, at the time one is appointed Dean, the department employing the other partner/spouse falls under the authority of the Dean, the incoming Dean (the Employee with Authority) must immediately disclose the Intimate Relationship to the Office of Employee and Labor Relations, which will initiate a management plan to eliminate any exercise of authority.
**Scenario B: What if, in the above situation, one person was recruited and hired as the college’s Dean and the other partner/spouse is co-recruited and hired as a faculty member within the college that would be supervised and evaluated by the Dean?**
**Nepotism Policy: MUST DISCLOSE IMMEDIATELY**
In this scenario, the Nepotism Policy would require that each person disclose their nepotic relationship to the other at the time of hire.
**Intimate Relations Regulation: MUST DISCLOSE IMMEDIATELY**
The Intimate Relations Regulation would require the one appointed Dean (in this scenario, the Employee with Authority) to immediately disclose the Intimate Relationship and trigger the consideration and creation of a management plan.
**Scenario C: A relationship develops between a staff member and a faculty member. The staff member works for a department of a college that the faculty member is in. What would happen under the Nepotism Policy? What about the Intimate Relations Regulation?**
**Nepotism Policy: MUST DISCLOSE IMMEDIATELY**
The Nepotism Policy, which requires disclosure of relationships, such as domestic partnerships, dating, or other personal relationships in which objectivity might be impaired, would require that each party disclose their nepotic relationship to the other.
**Intimate Relations Regulation: IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER ONE IS AN EMPLOYEE WITH AUTHORITY OVER THE OTHER. IF SO, THE RELATIONSHIP MUST BE DISCLOSED IMMEDIATELY.**
Unless the faculty member is an Employee with Authority over the staff member, or vice versa, the Intimate Relations Regulation would not be triggered. If, on the other hand, the faculty member is an Employee with Authority over the staff member, or vice versa, the Intimate Relations Regulation would be triggered, and the Employee with Authority must immediately disclose the Intimate Relationship and trigger the consideration and creation of a management plan.
