# Student-Athlete Academic Center
The Student Athlete Academic Center (SAAC) is the home for all student-athlete academic needs. The SAAC works under a student-centered approach and provides resources that will help student-athletes be successful in and outside the classroom. The SAAC’s resources include:
  * Academic meetings with an Academic Coordinator
  * Learning Specialists
  * Academic Support Services Coordinator
  * Tutoring, study areas, computer and writing labs


With the SAAC’s student-centered approach, student-athletes utilize an objective-based study hall system which will empower them to take ownership of their academic responsibilities. In doing this, the SAAC hopes to develop independent learners, a skill that will carry into life beyond college. Student-athletes are expected to meet NCAA, Conference USA, and FIU eligibility requirements

Ever since stepping foot on our campus, Romelo has been a model student-athlete. A natural leader, Romelo not only ensures that he is always on track academically, but makes sure those around him are also in good standing. We are expecting great things both athletically and academically from Romelo, and it is only a matter of time before the FIU community witnesses the excellence we have already seen.

**Kelsie Campbell** Swimming & Diving
Kelsie Campbell is a great model of what being a student-athlete is all about! Originally from England, Kelsie came to FIU this past fall to study Biochemistry and be a member of the Swimming and Diving team. Not only is Kelsie intelligent, but she is an extremely hard worker! She isn’t afraid to come to the SAAC and study for hours, or make extra tutoring appointments to make sure that she receives that 100% or makes that paper the best it possibly could be. Kelsie has a promising future ahead of her, keep up the hard work!
