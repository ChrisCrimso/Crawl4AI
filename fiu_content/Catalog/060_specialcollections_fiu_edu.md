_Betty Perry and the Women of FIU,_ the March/April exhibition in the Gallery at Green Library, is a celebration of Betty Perry, FIU’s first First Lady, and the many women who helped shape FIU. This exhibition commemorates Women’s History Month by recognizing the legacy of pioneering women at FIU. The exhibition also features the artwork of women faculty from FIU’s Department of Art + Art History, College of Communication, Architecture + the Arts (CARTA) showcasing their creative voices and contributions to the university's vibrant artistic community. Together, this exhibition reflects both the historical significance and contemporary artistic impact of the women who have played an integral role in shaping FIU’s mission and community.
Betty Laird Perry is the wife of the late Charles E. Perry, FIU’s founding president. In addition to serving as First Lady at FIU, Mrs. Perry is a nurse, an artist, and an early champion of the fine arts and women’s education at FIU. She completed her BS in Nursing and graduated with FIU’s first class in 1974, balancing her duties as a university president’s wife, a working mother, and a student. A dedicated supporter of education and the arts, Mrs. Perry was president of the Council for the Continuing Education of Women (CCEW) at Miami-Dade College from 1973 to 1975 and founder of Viva Las Artes, an organization promoting the fine arts at FIU. The Betty Laird Perry Student Purchase Award and the Betty Laird Perry Emerging Artist Collection at the Frost Art Museum are named in honor of Mrs. Perry’s commitment to supporting artists at FIU. After leaving FIU, Mrs. Perry earned an MS in Healthcare Policy and Planning at Georgia State University in Atlanta.This exhibition also features objects from the history of the Center for Women’s and Gender Studies (CWGS). Long before there was CWGS, there was the Institute for Women. The Institute for Women was established by President Perry in 1973 at the behest of prominent feminist Roxcy Bolton. Under the direction of Dr. Charlotte Tatro, the Institute established strong connections to women’s rights causes in South Florida. After budgetary concerns closed the Institute in 1979, women’s studies at FIU was revived with the opening of the Women’s Studies Center in 1982. Now under the direction of Dr. Marilyn Hoder-Salmon, the Women’s Studies Center established itself as a leader for women’s studies research activity in Florida.In addition to these women, the exhibition also features Marie Anderson, a pioneer in women’s journalism and the dean of University Relations and Development from 1972 to 1977. Marie Anderson was also a devoted women’s rights activist, serving as a chairperson on the Florida Governor’s Commission on the Status of Women and advocating for women’s rights around the country.
In contrast to the historical narratives of Betty Perry and the pioneering women who shaped FIU’s early years, the exhibition also highlights the vibrant and diverse artistic contributions of FIU's women faculty artists from the Department of Art + Art History, CARTA. These accomplished artists are continuing the legacy of empowerment and creativity. Through their innovative works in various media, these women faculty members are shaping contemporary artistic discourse, fostering an environment of collaboration, and inspiring future generations of artists. The juxtaposition of archival materials and contemporary artwork in this exhibition offers a unique lens through which to view the ongoing contributions of women at FIU—bridging the past with the present and demonstrating the enduring impact of women’s voices within both the academic and artistic communities.
