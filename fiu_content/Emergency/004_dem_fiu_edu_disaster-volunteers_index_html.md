# Disaster Volunteers
The FIU Disaster Volunteer program is the result of a University presidential directive to better engage the FIU community and to provide the necessary support to effectively activate and run emergency operations.
The program was launched in the summer of 2018, and consists of over 300 FIU students, faculty, and staff as of January 2019. FIU's Department of Emergency Management provides oversight to the program. The department is also responsible for maintaining the volunteer database as well as sharing upcoming training opportunities. Disaster Volunteers will receive training on the topics of disaster preparedness, first aid, bleeding control, and sheltering operations, to name a few. Once trained, volunteers will assist the University in the areas of sheltering operations, administrative services, logistical support, call center operations, or other disaster-related tasks to be completed either before, during, or after a disaster. Program assignments are strictly unpaid, and do not involve financial compensation for travel, lodging, or other expenses. Applications to join the program are available throughout the year and they are accepted on an ongoing basis.
