# Bomb Threat/Suspicious Packages
A bomb threat is defined as a threat to detonate an explosive or incendiary device to cause property damage, death, or injuries, whether or not such a device actually exists. All bomb threats are to be taken seriously.
If you receive a bomb threat by phone, remain calm, write down the caller’s exact words, and note the time of the call. Check for a caller ID number. Ensure to write down all the information you receive and follow the [bomb threat checklist](https://dem.fiu.edu/emergencies/bomb-threat/bomb-threat-checklist.pdf).
If practical, do not hang up the phone, but phone the police from a different telephone. Call 305-348-5911 or 911 and report the threat. The Administration, with the assistance of Campus Police and other local authorities, will determine a plan of action. A decision on whether or not to evacuate will be based on all available information received. If the decision is made to evacuate, instruct occupants to take lunches, purses, personal packages (they could be mistaken for concealed explosives) and EXIT the building. If ordered to evacuate, move at least 300 feet away from the building to designated evacuation area and wait for instructions. Stay away from glass.
**If you receive a bomb threat in written form,** notify University Police immediately by calling **305-348-5911 or dial 9-1-1.** Take no further action until you are advised to do so by police.
  * Do a quick visual inspection of your area. Do not touch or move suspicious objects.
  * Do not use radios, pagers, or cell phones as they can trigger an explosive device.
  * Follow your department’s evacuation procedures.


## **Identifying Suspicious Items**
  * Look closely around work area when you arrive for work. This will help you if you are called on to identify unusual or suspicious items later.
  * Report potential safety or security problems to University Police ext. 2626.
  * Be on the lookout for anything unusual, particularly packages or large items seemingly left behind or thrown out. Note time and location of anything odd.
  * If asked to assist in a search for a bomb:


1. Be thorough2. DO NOT USE 2-WAY RADIOS OR CELL PHONES3. Do not touch anything you suspect4. If necessary move people away from the suspicious item5. Look for anything and everything that might conceal a bomb6. Do not panic persons in the area
**Follow all instructions from the police.**
**![Suspicious Package Safety Tips](https://dem.fiu.edu/_assets/images/suspicious_package.png)**
If you suspect the mail or package contains a bomb (explosive), or radiological, biological, or chemical threat:
  * Isolate the area immediately
  * Call FIU Police at (305) 348-5911
  * Wash your hands with soap and water


**Explosion**
If you are in a building that experiences an explosion:
  * Activate the closest fire alarm and leave the building immediately.
  * Do not stop to retrieve personal possessions or make phone calls.
  * If objects are falling around you, get under a sturdy desk or table until they stop falling. Then leave quickly, watching for weakened floors and stairs and falling debris.
  * If there is a fire, stay low to the floor and exit the building as quickly as possible.
  * Do not use elevators, always use the stairs.
  * Cover your nose and mouth with a wet cloth or handkerchief. When approaching a closed door, use the back of your hand to feel the lower, middle, and upper parts of the door.
  * Never use the palm of your hand or your fingers to test for heat. If the door is not hot, open it slowly and ensure that fire and/ or smoke is not blocking your escape route before continuing.
  * Be prepared to crawl as smoke, poisonous gases and heat rise. If the door is hot, do not open it, but try to escape through a window. If you are on a high floor, hang a white or light-colored cloth outside the window to alert fire fighters of your location.
  * If you are trapped in debris, do not move about or kick up dust. Shout only as a last resort when you hear sounds and think someone will hear you. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.
