# Hazardous Weather
**What are weather hazards?**
Severe weather hazards such as hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, extreme heat, hail, flooding, winds, winter weather, and more are dangerous weather phenomena that threaten life and property. Many of these phenomena are related to atmospheric conditions that can be monitored and forecasted. The National Weather Service (NWS) is responsible for issuing forecasts, watch and warning products for a variety of weather and water hazards.
**Warning****Take Action!**|  A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.  
---|---  
**Watch****Be Prepared**|  A watch is used when the risk of hazardous weather or a hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.  
**Advisory****Be Aware**|  An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.  
### Why do weather hazards matter?
Weather hazards impact the entire country, with enormous effects on the economy and public safety. Since 1980, weather/climate disasters have cost the U.S. economy more than $1 trillion. Severe storms affect business operations and consumers everywhere causing damage to infrastructure and interfering with day-to-day operations. Several billion-dollar weather/climate disasters affect the United States in an average year.
**Stay Informed**
Florida International University maintains an Emergency Notification System called FIU Alert, for the purpose of issuing an immediate notification to keep the FIU community informed and safe during an emergency situation. Email, SMS text messages, and voice calls are part of the FIU Alert system that allows you to receive emergency updates. All official FIU emergency notifications will be sent out through FIU Alert. Faculty, staff, and students are urged to register to receive these notifications. To register, please visit <https://dem.fiu.edu/fiu-alert/sign-up/index.html>.
