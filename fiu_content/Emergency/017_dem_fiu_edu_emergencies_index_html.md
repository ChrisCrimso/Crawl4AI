# Emergencies
Everyone has a critical role and shared responsibility when it comes to emergencies. Being prepared for any emergency is a responsibility we take seriously at FIU. Therefore University students, faculty and staff should be prepared and take appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families, pets and properties when calamity occurs. 
Some of the basic protective actions are similar for multiple hazards. For example, safety is necessary when experiencing all hazards, whether this means sheltering or evacuating depends on the specific emergency. Developing a communications plan or making an emergency supply kit are the same for accidental emergencies, natural disasters and also terrorism. However, there are important differences among potential emergencies that should impact the decisions you make and the actions you take.
## What You Can Do?
Use the resources to the left to learn about the potential emergencies that can happen where you work and live and the appropriate ways to respond to them. When you know what to do, you can plan with your household or workplace and prepare in advance to be ready. These links also provide information about how protect your household or workplace and begin recovery following the initial disaster.
## Be Prepared
Before a disaster, learn how you will know there is an impending hazardous event. Familiarize yourself with the signs of events that come without warning and know the local advance alerts and warnings and how you will receive them. Knowing about the local emergency plans for shelter and evacuation and local emergency contacts will help you develop your own household and work place plan.
Learn how to build your own emergency supply kit so you're fully prepared.
