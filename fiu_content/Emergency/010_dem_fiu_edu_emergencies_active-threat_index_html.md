# Active Threat
Events of the past years have called attention to the need to be prepared for a wide range of emergencies. The tragedies at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and Stoneman Douglas High School have caused campuses across the country to reassess their level of preparedness. The Florida International University Police Department is committed to continuously training our officers to respond to all types of critical incidents, including active shooters.
An active assailant is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. The event is unpredictable and evolves quickly.
### HOW YOU CAN PREPARE
  * Have a plan and always be aware of your surroundings.
  * In an active threat situation remember to Run, Hide, or Fight.


The awareness and preparedness of members of our community are equally important. We present this information for your use and distribution.
**If you witness any suspicious activity on campus at any time, immediately contact University Police at****305-348-5911 or dial 9-1-1. Please remember “if you see something say something.**
### FLEE THE BUILDING IF SAFE TO DO SO:
  * If it is possible to flee the area safely and avoid danger, do so. Do not attempt to flee if the assailant is between you and the exit. If you are unsure, do not attempt to flee.
  * Once outside, get far away from the incident scene.
  * If you encounter Police Officers as you leave the building they may direct you to one collection point.
  * Keep your hands visible (on your head or showing open in front of you).
  * Do not pull the fire alarm, it will provide the assailant with more opportunities to cause harm.
  * Contact University Police at 305-348-5911 or via 9-1-1 if you have information to provide about the situation.


### IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO FLEE THE BUILDING, SECURE YOUR IMMEDIATE AREA OR MOVE TO A SAFE AREA:
  * Turn off all the lights and close blinds, lock all windows and doors.
  * Turn off radios and computer monitors.
  * Silence all cell phones.
  * If you can do so safely, get everyone on the floor and out of the line of fire.
  * Keep everyone calm, quiet and out of sight.
  * Take adequate cover/protection (i.e. concrete walls, thick desks, filing cabinets).
  * Place signs on exterior windows to identify the location of injured persons.
  * Stay in your secure location of the building until an "all clear" instruction is given by an authorized or known voice.
  * If the staff or students do not recognize the voice that is giving instruction, they should not change their status. Unknown or unfamiliar voices may be false and designed to give false assurances.


### IF THE ASSAILANT ENTERS YOUR CLASS OR OFFICE:
  * There is no one procedure that can be recommended in this situation.
  * Attempt to get the word out to other staff if possible, and call 911 if that seems practical.
  * Trust your instincts. If you cannot run or hide, remain quiet. Attempting to negotiate with the individual may be very dangerous.
  * Attempting to overcome the individual with force is a last resort that should only be initiated in the most extreme circumstances.
  * There may be more than one active assailant.
  * Be careful not to make any changes to the scene of the incident since law enforcement authorities will investigate the area later.


### WHAT TO REPORT:
  * Your specific location: building name, floor and office or room number.
  * Number of people at your specific location.
  * Injuries: number injured and types of injuries.
  * Assailant(s): 
    *       * Location
      * Number of suspects
      * Race/gender
      * Clothing description
      * Physical features (height, weight, facial hair, glasses, etc.)
      * Type of weapons (long gun or hand gun, knife, etc)
      * Backpack
      * Shooter's identity, if known
      * Do you hear explosions separate from gunfire?
