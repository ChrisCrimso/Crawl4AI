This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021. The original manuscript circulated in the XIX century and was an influence on the island and abroad. The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years prior to the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830 who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island. 
GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.
This event is co-sponsored by the Kimberly Green Latin America and Caribbean Center and FIU Libraries. This event is made possible with the support of LACC's Department of Education Title VI Grant. This event is free and open to the public. This event will be conducted in Spanish. To confirm your in-person attendance, please write or call (305) 348–1991.

As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida. 
The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/>

Cuba’s Eternal Night follows 5 Cubans over 2 harrowing years as they struggle with government repression, scarcity of food and medicine, and the biggest mass exodus the island has ever experienced. Yet amidst the darkness, these five individuals choose to share their lives, boldly and on camera, offering a rare and intimate look inside a nation unraveling. <br /> <br />Jordan Allott is a documentary filmmaker and founder of In Altum Productions (IAP). His work explores themes ranging from international human rights and American politics to Catholic spirituality. <br /> <br />Yoe Suárez is an award-winning journalist and writer. He was an independent journalist in Cuba during the filming and became the film´s field producer. He now lives in the U.S. <br /> <br />Father Alberto Reyes Pías is a Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Camagüey, Cuba. He is one of the most articulate and courageous voices on freedom in Cuba today. <br /> <br />This event is free and open to the public. It will be held in Spanish.

<title>May 29, 2025: Language, Culture, and Society in Havana in 1830 at GL - Green Library</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dictionaries and encyclopedias from Europe inspired a group of intellectuals in Havana to compile the typical voices of Cuba around 1830. This effort resulted in a vocabulary that remained unpublished for 190 years, until Dr. Chávez-Rivera edited and published it in 2021. The original manuscript circulated in the XIX century and was an influence on the island and abroad. The objective of this conference is to identify particularities of that interest in the Spanish language and the inclination for lexicographic activity in Cuba in the years prior to the appearance of Esteban Pichardo’s Diccionario provincial de voces cubanas in 1836. This conference reconstructs the creative and bibliographic environment of that pioneering group in 1830 who had the good sense to work as a team, recognize aspects of Cuban identity, and capture the various voices and phrases used by their contemporaries on the island. </p> <p> </p> <p>GUEST SPEAKER: Dr. Armando Chávez-Rivera. Associate Professor and Director of the Spanish Program at the University of Houston-Victoria, Texas, and a Scholar in Residence at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress. Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.</p> <p> </p> <p>This event is co-sponsored by the Kimberly Green Latin America and Caribbean Center and FIU Libraries. This event is made possible with the support of LACC's Department of Education Title VI Grant. This event is free and open to the public. This event will be conducted in Spanish. To confirm your in-person attendance, please write <a href="mailto:cri@fiu.edu">cri@fiu.edu</a> or call (305) 348–1991.</p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/language-culture-and-society-in-havana-in-1830-3028">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Language%2C+Culture%2C+and+Society+in+Havana+in+1830&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+May+29%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0ADictionaries+and+encyclopedias+from+Europe+inspired+a+group+of+intellectuals+in+Havana+to+compile+the+typical+voices+of+Cuba+around+1830.+This+effort+resulted+in+a+vocabulary+that+remained+unpublished+for+190+years%2C+until+Dr.+Ch%C3%A1vez-Rivera+edited+and+published+it+in+2021.+The+original+manuscript+circulated+in+the+XIX+century+and+was+an+influence+on+the+island+and+abroad.+The+objective+of+this+conference+is+to+identify+particularities+of+that+interest+in+the+Spanish+language+and+the+inclination+for+lexicographic+activity+in+Cuba+in+the+years+prior+to+the+appearance+of+Esteban+Pichardo%E2%80%99s+Diccionario+provincial+de+voces+cubanas+in+1836.+This+conference+reconstructs+the+creative+and+bibliographic+environment+of+that+pioneering+group+in+1830+who+had+the+good+sense+to+work+as+a+team%2C+recognize+aspects+of+Cuban+identity%2C+and+capture+the+various+voices+and+phrases+used+by+their+contemporaries+on+the+island.++%0A%0A+%0A%0AGUEST+SPEAKER%3A+Dr.+Armando+Ch%C3%A1vez-Rivera.+Associate+Professor+and+Director+of+the+Spanish+Program+at+the+University+of+Houston-Victoria%2C+Texas%2C+and+a+Scholar+in+Residence+at+the+Kluge+Center+at+the+Library+of+Congress.+Member+of+the+North+American+Academy+of+the+Spanish+Language.%0A%0A+%0A%0AThis+event+is+co-sponsored+by+the+Kimberly+Green+Latin+America+and+Caribbean+Center+and+FIU+Libraries.+This+event+is+made+possible+with+the+support+of+LACC%27s+Department+of+Education+Title+VI+Grant.+This+event+is+free+and+open+to+the+public.++This+event+will+be+conducted+in+Spanish.+To+confirm+your+in-person+attendance%2C+please+write+cri%40fiu.edu+or+call+%28305%29+348%E2%80%931991.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Flanguage-culture-and-society-in-havana-in-1830-3028%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>

<title>Jun 19, 2025: FIU Celebrates Juneteenth</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom and achievement, while encouraging continuous self-development. As recommended in our Equity Action Initiative, FIU seeks to align with the spirit of this holiday, to make Juneteenth an official day of observance at Florida International University. Additionally, we stand in support of the Student Government Association of Florida.</p> <p>The theme for FIU first inaugural Juneteenth celebration is “Educate, Celebrate, and Heal”. Educating, celebrating, and embracing the truths of Juneteenth can serve to expand the collective knowledge of our entire FIU community and accelerate an appreciation for the Black history excluded from pedagogy, that may have framed a different America. Celebrating Juneteenth complements the work of the Founding Fathers, being the architects of the Declaration of Independence, and brings to the conversation, the 400 years Blacks have tried to achieve equality in enjoying ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. During this week of observance, we will provide programming and activities to commemorate Juneteenth beginning June 14 and culminating with a Juneteenth Freedom Day Celebration on Saturday, June 19 from 10am to 4pm. To learn more about this celebration, visit <a href="https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/">https://ace.fiu.edu/juneteenth/</a></p> <p><a href="https://calendar.fiu.edu/event/fiu_celebrates_juneteenth">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+FIU+Celebrates+Juneteenth&amp;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Jun+19%2C+2025%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AJuneteenth+celebrates+African+American+freedom+and+achievement%2C+while+encouraging+continuous+self-development.+As+recommended+in+our+Equity+Action+Initiative%2C+FIU+seeks+to+align+with+the+spirit+of+this+holiday%2C+to+make+Juneteenth+an+official+day+of+observance+at+Florida+International+University.+Additionally%2C+we+stand+in+support+of+the+Student+Government+Association+of+Florida.%0A%0AThe+theme+for+FIU+first+inaugural+Juneteenth+celebration+is+%E2%80%9CEducate%2C+Celebrate%2C+and+Heal%E2%80%9D.+Educating%2C+celebrating%2C+and+embracing+the+truths+of+Juneteenth+can+serve+to+expand+the+collective+knowledge+of+our+entire+FIU+community+and+accelerate+an+appreciation+for+the+Black+history+excluded+from+pedagogy%2C+that+may+have+framed+a+different+America.+Celebrating+Juneteenth+complements+the+work+of+the+Founding+Fathers%2C+being+the+architects+of+the+Declaration+of+Independence%2C+and+brings+to+the+conversation%2C+the+400+years+Blacks+have+tried+to+achieve+equality+in+enjoying+%E2%80%98life%2C+liberty+and+the+pursuit+of+happiness%E2%80%99.+During+this+week+of+observance%2C+we+will+provide+programming+and+activities+to+commemorate+Juneteenth+beginning+June+14+and+culminating+with+a+Juneteenth+Freedom+Day+Celebration+on+Saturday%2C+June+19+from+10am+to+4pm.+To+learn+more+about+this+celebration%2C+visit+https%3A%2F%2Face.fiu.edu%2Fjuneteenth%2F%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcalendar.fiu.edu%2Fevent%2Ffiu_celebrates_juneteenth%0A">Email this event</a></p> ]]>
