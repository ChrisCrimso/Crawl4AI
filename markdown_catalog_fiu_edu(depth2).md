FIU - Journey to the Top of the World Journey to the Top of the World First Video Journey to the Top of the World FIU researcher leads team of U.S. scientists on international mission to map geochemistry of Arctic Ocean HEADPHONES RECOMMENDED WRITTEN BY: JOEL DELGADO PHOTOGRAPHS BY: TIM LONG/FIU VIDEOS BY: TIM LONG/FIU, CHRIS NECUZE/FIU and BILL SCHMOKER/PolarTREC U.S. Coast Guard Captain Jason Hamilton stood on the bridge of the Healy in the early morning hours of Sept. 5, 2015. After 27 days in the western Arctic Ocean, he was ready to make a major announcement. "Ahoy, shipmates," he began, his voice traveling through the ship's intercom system. "At 0747, Coast Guard cutter Healy reached the North Pole. We became the first unaccompanied U.S. surface vessel to do so. Thank you for your initiative and cooperation, which led to this historic event. Have a good morning." Captain Jason Hamilton, Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy U.S. Coast Guard research icebreaker Healy, Dutch Harbor, Alaska David Kadko, FIU Chief Scientist. Geotraces Summer 2015 Artic Expedition onboard the U.S Coast Guard research icebreaker Healy. Dutch Harbor, Alaska David Kadko, FIU Chief Scientist. Geotraces Summer 2015 Artic Expedition onboard the U.S Coast Guard research icebreaker Healy. Dutch Harbor, Alaska It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment for the 140 scientists, technicians and Coast Guard personnel aboard the icebreaker, like-minded adventurers who had signed on to participate in one of the most extensive research expeditions in the history of Arctic Ocean research. There would be time to celebrate and reflect on this historic accomplishment, but it would have to come later. There was still too much work to be done. Making it to the North Pole was just one stop on the expeditionâs 64-day, 5,000-mile journey. Hailing from Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Florida and parts in between, these scientists were part of a larger, multimillion-doll...

Incoming Freshmen Transfer Students Graduate School FIU Online International Freshmen An international freshman is a student who has completed or will soon complete high school and who has yet to enroll in a 2- or 4-year college or university. Early Fall Direct Early Fall Direct is a pathway for students who elect to begin in June for the Summer term. We also offer this pathway to applicants who applied for the Fall, but whose academic profile benefits from an earlier start to their college career. Beginning in the Early Fall Direct term allows students to transition to FIU before the rush of the Fall term. All students are required to take 9 Summer credits to graduate from FIU.

Is it okay to scan the printed page to a PDF file? When I copy and paste abstracts into the Submit form, some formatted text reverts to plain text. What's going on?

Air Force awards FIU $4.82 million to propel research on origami antennas | FIU News - Florida International University Skip to Content Florida International University Air Force awards FIU $4.82 million to propel research on origami antennas Search Menu Menu Air Force awards FIU $4.82 million to propel research on origami antennas Second round of funding boosts convergence research and enhances workforce development efforts Science & Technology By Diana Hernandez-Alende September 10, 2019 at 10:00am The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) has awarded FIU an additional $4.82 million to expand its groundbreaking research on origami antennas. Last year, the AFOSR granted $4.82 million to establish the Transforming Antennas Center (TAC). The funding total, close to $10 million, will be distributed over six years. TAC develops innovative and advanced origami-based antennas for the next-generation of Air Force and Department of Defense systems. The dynamically adaptable antennas can be compactly stowed, easily collapsed and quickly deployed, enhancing, for example, the agility of warfighters in the battlefield and satellite communications. The new grant builds on existing research, such as the expansion of designs and materials to be used, and will enable TAC to perform fundamental studies as well as develop new computational tools and building blocks for these robust foldable antenna systems. It will also support convergence research and enhance the center’s workforce development efforts. “The grant augments TAC’s workforce development initiatives by increasing the number of postdoctoral researchers, Ph.D. students and undergraduate students for our already strong research in the radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave/5G applications," said John Volakis, dean of FIU’s College of Engineering & Computing. "It will also contribute to state-of-the-art undergraduate and graduate curricula in antennas and electromagnetics and strengthens collaboration with indus...

Three students are competing for their countries on the international stage. Miami native and psychology major Angelica Delgado will be representing the United States in judo. It will be her second appearance in the Olympics; she competed in the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two students from FIU Athletics' own Conference USA-champion swimming and diving team also will be competing. Maha Gouda is representing Egypt on the diving platforms, while Elinah Phillip is swimming for the British Virgin Island team and will be one of the nation’s two flag bearers for the Opening Ceremony on July 23. Elinah Phillip puts her paws up in Tokyo. “Representing your country in the Olympic Games is a lifelong dream for all athletes in our sport,” said coach Randy Horner. “Maha and Elinah are getting the opportunity to do it for a second time. This is truly special! We are excited for them and will be cheering with paws up from FIU!” It will be both Panthers' second time on the Olympic stage as Gouda and Phillip made their debuts at the 2016 Games. Gouda will compete in the women’s 10-meter platform, where she finished 24th in Rio. Phillip is set to swim in the women’s 50-meter Freestyle. The Panther sophomore was the VI’s youngest athlete and the first to represent the Territory in aquatics at any Olympics when she finished 48th in the women’s 50 free at the 2016 Games.

An FIU professor, who specializes in theoretical optimization and learning algorithms, and his research team at FIU, have created a dashboard that can predict the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 using data analytics. The tool, created by M. Hadi Amini , assistant professor, and his research team, including undergraduate researcher, Meleik Hyman, and doctoral student, Ahmed Imteaj, from the School of Computing and Information Sciences within the College of Engineering & Computing , forecasts the cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The dashboard allows users to select a specific country or city on a global map. The map shows data reflecting the confirmed number of cases and deaths, and the number of recovered patients. “I’m fascinated by data and knew we needed to adapt to the new situation we’re all facing,” said Amini. “My students and I were observing the current dashboards available online and how they show real-time data. But, we were looking to design something predictive that could be understandable for everyone.” The data found in the dashboard predicts daily and is updated frequently using spatiotemporal data collection. Spatiotemporal data collection refers to the process of discovering patterns and knowledge of data that describes a phenomenon in a particular location and period of time. Typical examples include uncovering weather patterns, hurricane prediction and climate change trends. In this case, Amini is using it for CO...

As chef de mission , Rodriguez will be a mentor, sponsor and spokesperson for the RPT team throughout the Paralympic games. Born and raised in Cuba, Rodriguez found her love for sports when she was very young. She began swimming when she was 7 years old and later developed a strong passion for ballet. But, when she was 13, she was diagnosed with a spinal cord malformation and a stroke left her unable to walk. Rodriguez and her family moved to the United States when she was 15 years old, where she began swimming again for her high school team. Her coach at the time believed she had the potential to make it far in the sport, but her citizenship status left her unable to compete for her country. At 21 years old, while earning her degree in architecture at FIU, and after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rodriguez returned to the pool and started retraining with her high school coach. In 2012, Rodriguez made the U.S. national team and went on to compete for Team USA in the London 2012 Paralympic Games . She was a finalist in the Women’s 100m breaststroke SB5 in London. Rodriguez competing in London 2012 Paralympic Games Rodriguez credits the Department of Architecture faculty for helping her balance her swimming career and her architecture degree at the same time. “The faculty was amazing and very flexible with my competitions and training schedule,” she says. “I am very grateful to Marilys Nepomechie, in particular, who guided me on this crazy...

The neural-enabled prosthetic hand (NEPH) system, which Jung developed at FIU with her Adaptive Neural Systems Laboratory team, restores a sense of touch/grasp force and hand opening by stimulating sensory nerve fibers in the residual limb with fine wires implanted inside nerves. As muscle activity controls the motors in the prosthetic hand, sensors in the prosthetic hand provide information that commands an implanted neurostimulator to deliver stimulation pulses to the sensory nerve fibers. The elicited sensations can improve control of the prosthesis. “Although advances in prosthetics have allowed U.S. veterans and service members to live more comfortable lives, many are still dissatisfied with their prostheses and stop using them,” said Ranu Jung, chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering within the College of Engineering & Computing and a Wallace H. Coulter Eminent Scholars Chair in biomedical engineering. “We developed the NEPH system to improve the quality of life of people with upper-limb amputation, many of whom served in the military. We hope this technology, that is designed to provide senses of touch and grasp force, will allow them to perfor...

Restoring the Everglades to ensure South Floridaâs freshwater supply FIU’s decades-long scientific leadership in a long-term Florida Everglades restoration project is central to protecting South Florida’s freshwater ecosystem — and a model for the restoration of imperiled ecosystems worldwide. Science & Technology October 11, 2023 at 9:00am — By Karen Cochrane , Angela Nicoletti and Adrienne Sylver — Many parts of the world are facing a freshwater crisis. Severe, long-lasting drought conditions not seen for thousands of years gripped much of the U.S. in 2022. Coalinga, a small town in California, made headlines because water was expected to run out by December. In our rapidly changing world, could any town become Coalinga? That’s a question Todd Crowl , director of the Institute of Environment , wonders about. It’s hard not to. Florida’s future is intricately connected to the fate of vitally important freshwater ecosystems. In search of solutions, Crowl and institute scientists know one thing for certain: Hope for South Florida’s resilience can be found in the restoration of a freshwater wetland among the world’s largest and most important — the Everglades. What happens to it, happens to us. Unraveling the complexity of how it all works is an enormous challenge. Almost as enormous as the Everglades. FIU researchers have always faced it head on. Nearly 20 years ago, their findings set water quality standards by advising the restriction of phosphorus to 10 parts per billion for Everglades National Park, a standard incorporated into the federal Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). And for more than two decades, FIU has le...

Christian Sports Faith moves mountains: Meet Panther defensive back CJ Christian By Gisela Maria Valencia September 19, 2023 at 11:13am C.J. Christian has loved football since he was five years old. He would spend his days on a football field in his hometown of Normal, Illinois, watching his older brothers play, his sister cheerleading and his mom coaching the cheerleaders. “I was around football 24/7,” he says. “I couldn’t wait to play.” When he turned seven, the age minimum at his youth league, he threw himself into the sport and never looked back. By the time he arrived at FIU, he had earned a reputation for his athleticism and can-do spirit. As a  Panther, he made a strong showing as a defensive back, earning his spot as an opening day starter. In his first few games, he totaled 17 tackles, including a tackle for loss and an interception. He registered six stops in the season-opening win over Bryant University. In his fourth game, he suffered a season-ending injury, dislocating his shoulder. After working hard to recover, the communication major came back onto the field this fall ready to go. In just four games, he has totaled 21 tackles. And he was recently honored as a member of the ProFootballFocus’ (PFF) College Football Team of the Week after recording an interception, six tackles and two pass breakups during FIU’s victory over University of North Texas on Sept. 9. “The good thing about CJ is that he always wants to keep getting better,” says Head Football Coach Mike MacIntyre, who praises Christian for his athleticism. “He has excellent ball skills, good eyes, can judge a football and make plays on it. He can cover, he can run, he can fill the alley. He’s a dual threat type safety. He’s really, really tough. Like a ...

Lifehacks Communicating science: grad students give it their best shot By Brandie Course April 3, 2025 at 3:13pm How do you condense a complex, multi-year research project into a three-minute presentation? That’s the task that graduate students take on every year when they share their research during the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. 3MT was established in 2008 by the University of Queensland in Australia. The competition helps graduate students learn to explain their research succinctly and in language that non-specialists can understand. 3MT competitions have since expanded globally and are now held at over 900 universities in more than 85 countries. At FIU, s tudents entered into preliminary competitions within their colleges, and the winners advanced to the final round, during which they pitched their research to a panel of judges and a live audience. Judges selected first- and second- place winners, and the audience picked a People’s Choice winner. The skills that 3MT competitors hone are invaluable for everyone. This year’s finalists are eager to share advice that will help students in academics and their careers. Shivam Agarwal, a doctoral candidate in business administration, studies the unique dynamics and strategies involved in engaging consumers in virtual space. He encourages students to take a bold approach that shows their commitment to their chosen topic. “Be passionate about your research,” he says.

Science & Technology FIU in the news May 31, 2022 at 9:32am The Wall of Wind can create Category 5 hurricane winds for testing life-size structures. Margi Rentis/Florida International University Richard Olson , Florida International University ; Ameyu B. Tolera , Florida International University ; Arindam Chowdhury , Florida International University , and Ioannis Zisis , Florida International University In an airplane hangar in Miami, engineers are recreating some of the most powerful hurricane winds to ever strike land. These Category 5 winds can shatter a test building in the blink of an eye. Yet the giant fans creating them aren’t powerful enough to keep up with nature. When engineers built the Wall of Wind test facility 10 years ago at Florida International University, it was inspired by Hurricane Andrew , a monster of a storm that devastated South Florida in 1992. The facility was designed to test structures’ ability to withstand winds up to 160 miles per hour (257 kilometers per hour). Now, we’re seeing the likes of Hurricane Dorian , which shredded neighborhoods in the Bahamas with 184 mph (296 km/h) winds in 2019, and Hurricane Patricia , with winds clocked at 215 mph (346 km/h) off the coast of Mexico in 2015. Hurricane Dorian’s Category 5 winds tore apart communities in the Bahamas.

Students, staff and community walked laps around the Ryder Business Loop at the 2023 FIU Relay for Life Relay for Life The weekend kicked off with the annual Relay for Life, a national event that came to campus 19 years ago and has since raised millions for the American Cancer Society. The event brought together students and staff with cancer survivors and caregivers in the Ryder Business Loop to bond in the hope that there will one day be a cure for cancer, which is the second-most common cause of death in the United States with 1.9 million new cases and nearly 610,000 deaths expected to occur in 2023. Hundreds of luminarias – candlelit memorials decorated to honor family and friends lost as well as those still battling – lined the walking path. Opposite the luminarias stood more than 30 themed tables decorated by student clubs, Greek organizations, FIU departments and other relay teams, who were selling snacks or jewelry, hosting chance games for prizes, and more, the proceeds of which were counted toward FIU’s fundraising total. Following tradition, the relay began with a lap for survivors and caregivers. Later in the evening, participants also took a silent lap in remembrance of those lost to cancer.

One in five FIU undergraduates is first-generation. In recognition of its programs and initiatives supporting these students, FIU has been designated by the center as a First Forward institution since 2017. Achieving the prestigious First Scholars milestone – an advanced designation – is recognition of FIU’s university-wide priority to intentionally provide wrap-around support services, financial assistance and more to support its first-generation students, who face unique challenges as they attempt to break familial cycles and chart new paths. “Our first-generation Panthers are among our hardest-working students, especially considering the challenges they face navigating university life without the advice and past experiences of family members who have already been through the process themselves,” said Phillip Lloyd Hamilton, assistant vice president for Student Equity and Support. “Their determination to succeed is an inspiration, and we are committed to supporting their academic and professional achieve...

A living legend: President Emeritus Modesto A. Maidique retires from the faculty

Maidique retires from the faculty Search Menu Menu A living legend: President Emeritus Modesto A. Maidique retires from the faculty Campus & Community By Alexandra Pecharich May 8, 2025 at 12:01pm Nearly 16 years after retiring as FIU’s longest-serving president, Modesto A. Maidique this week closed the final chapter of his storied academic career. The president emeritus followed a transformational 23 years as the head of Miami’s public research institution with an impressive tenure as a professor who taught undergraduate students and the founder and director of a leadership program for high-level executives. The community now sees him off with gratitude and praise as it credits him with building the foundation on which FIU stands today as a Top 50 public university. A man of vision Born in Havana in 1940, Maidique arrived in the United States just after high school and went on to earn an undergraduate degree and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from MIT. He served as CEO of semiconductor and genetic engineering companies and senior partner at the world’s then-largest venture capital firm. In 1986, he accepted the top position at Florida International University, at the time a still-evolving, little-known institution opened in 1972 primarily to educate local residents. His arrival heralded the start of a remarkable expansion of FIU and an emergence on the national scene that would take away the breath of all who worked alongside him. “For Miami to attract companies, you have to have a top-notch public university,” he announced at a meeting on his first day on the job, recalls former longtime FIU administrator and current benefactor Ruth Hamilton. “‘There are a lot of elements I’m going to bring,’” she remembers him saying with a brashness that ha...

Exceptional students recognized for leadership, scholarship and spirit | FIU News - Florida International University Skip to Content Florida International University Exceptional students recognized for leadership, scholarship and spirit Search Menu Menu Exceptional students recognized for leadership, scholarship and spirit Campus & Community By Clara-Meretan Kiah April 8, 2025 at 11:00am Twenty-three students and two student clubs were recognized last week for stand-out leadership, service and scholarship at the 2025 Outstanding Student Life Awards. For nearly 30 years, the annual ceremony has recognized Panthers who excel academically and in the areas of distinguished service to others, citizenship, innovation, leadership, civic engagement and promotion of the Panther spirit. Among these remarkable students, two especially outstanding Panthers stood apart from the crowd, earning special recognition with the FIU Presidential Award and the Larry W. Lunsford Leadership Award. The President Award is given to one student each year who has gone above and beyond any one award category to demonstrate leadership, dedication and action, thereby significantly enhancing life on campus and advancing the university’s prestige. This year’s Presidential Award was received by Yashas Hariprasad, a computer science doctoral candidate whose groundbreaking research in artificial intelligence addresses one of the most urgent technological crises of the 21st century: the global proliferation of deepfake scams. Expecting to graduate this month, Yashas already has three U.S. patents pending and has published 18 peer-reviewed research papers, book chapters and conference papers as well as having co-authored two books. Beyond the lab, Yashas is dedicated to helping fellow Panthers, having mentored more than a dozen students and supervised ten student laboratory projects.

He can even serve the ball, thanks in part to a novel exercise program incorporating use of a body-powered 3D-printed prosthetic hand. Designed to help patients better manage everyday tasks, the program offers hope for more convenient, cost-effective therapy options for children with congenital upper limb deficiencies. Hayden’s mom, physical therapist Amanda Thomas in the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences , and her Doctor of Physical Therapy students created the at-home program in which Hayden’s strength, range of motion and coordination improved markedly. His 3D-printed hand was created at FIU’s Miami Beach Urban Studios , and the pattern for the adult-sized hand was modified with assistance from university biomedical engineers. Thomas’s study has received global interest since its publication in the Journal of Hand Therapy.

The encryption method protects sensitive videos from quantum computers — a rare but extremely powerful form of computer. FIU’s innovation stands to enhance cybersecurity for a wide range of videos, including those containing intellectual property, security surveillance footage and financial information. The research, published in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics , was led by S. S. Iyengar, Distinguished University Professor at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences; Yashas Hariprasad, a Ph.D. candidate on the FIU team at the time of the research; and Naveen Kumar Chaudhary of India’s National Forensic Sciences University. “Our quantum-safe encryption addresses three critical challenges in cybersecurity,” Hariprasad says. "We are preparing for quantum threats that will emerge within the next decade as these computers gain greater interest; creating scalable solutions that can protect real-time applications like Zoom; and optimizing efficiency so organizations don't have to choose between security and performance." Quantum computers work differently than their traditional counterparts. Instead of using the traditional binary digits (0s and 1s) used in classical computers, quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits), allowing them to handle unusually large amounts of data in real time.

More booze in the barrel: Alumâs invention solves spirits industry problem | FIU News - Florida International University Skip to Content Florida International University More booze in the barrel: Alumâs invention solves spirits industry problem Search Menu Menu Science & Technology More booze in the barrel: Alumâs invention solves spirits industry problem By Adrienne Sylver May 6, 2025 at 9:00am During the Jameson Distillery tour on a vacation to Dublin in 2019, Jeremy Grunewald was captivated by the guide’s admission that thousands of bottles of whiskey are lost each day due to evaporation and cask leakage. For the chemical engineer who had worked in the roofing industry for a decade, it was an aha moment. He began to wonder if the technology behind the specialized coatings and sealants he used to make a roof watertight could be used on whiskey barrels. Grunewald, who graduated from FIU’s College of Engineering & Computing in 2022 with a master’s degree in engineering management, is now founder and CEO of Devil’s Cask. The company produces a patented clear coating known as SpiritLock Technology, that provides vapor protection — reducing evaporation and barrel leaks — when applied to the outside of a cask. It can be used for any alcohol that is aged in a barrel, including bourbon, rum, tequila, cognac and even some wines. Grunewald credits FIU with his ability to start a new business and take his product from conception to the marketplace. It was a process that gained momentum during his business and entrepreneurial class after he returned to FIU from his Ireland vacation. Grunewald is presented a $10,000 award at the 2024 DISCUS Annual Conference and Women of the Vine & Spirits Global Connect! in San Diego by Heather Fritzsche, CEO of the Spearhead Group, and Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “Everyone in the class was told to pitch ideas for a business.

Residing exclusively in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow has been endangered for nearly 60 years. Today, less than 2,500 remain. FIU doctoral candidate Alan Mock and a team of researchers now have growing concerns about a hidden threat lurking in the bird's food supply – mercury.  Their latest research, published in Ecotoxicology, suggests male sparrows that have higher rates of mercury have significantly lower chances of scoring a mate – a major problem for a bird already struggling to survive amid habitat loss and degradation. This is the first research published on mercury concentrations in the Cape Sable seaside sparrow, Mock said. To measure mercury levels, the researchers collected feathers from adult and young sparrows during three breeding seasons between 2016 and 2018. They found local water conditions directly influenced mercury exposure in the secretive birds which measure no more than 5 inches when fully grown. The faster drying of marshes led to higher mercury levels which led to early breeding failure. Mock said fewer love connections could mean a devastating 60 percent drop in the population productivity.

The event, for which entrants prepare for months, aims to improve the communication skills of young researchers by taking them through the process of  "translating," or making relatable, the research they do so that anyone might understand its significance. Daniel Martinez Perez is a Ph.D. candidate in the Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work whose presentation on his Alzheimer's investigation won him first place at the campus competition this year and advanced him to the national contest. Perez is investigating TSPO, a biomarker of neuroinflammation, and its role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Early findings show that TSPO levels increase well before memory loss occurs, offering hope for early detection and improved treatments. He shares his experience as a researcher and competitor. How did you get started studying Alzheimer's? I started studying Alzheimer's as a master's degree student when I joined a group of neuroscientists in Antioquia, Colombia. The research group has been studying a Colombian family with a rare mutation for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. The members of this family develop Alzheimer's in their 40s and die in their 50s.

Natapat Ariyamongkol/iStock/Getty Images Plus What is a downburst? These winds can be as destructive as tornadoes â we recreate them to test building designs Science & Technology By Amal Elawady, Fahim Ahmed, Mohamed Eissa and Omar Metwally April 30, 2025 at 9:18am From a distance, a downburst can look like a torrent of heavy rain . But at ground level, its behavior can be far more destructive. When a downburst’s winds hit the ground, they shoot out horizontally in all directions, sometimes with enough force to shatter windows and overturn vehicles. These winds behave in complicated ways , particularly in cities, as our latest research shows. Downburst winds can deflect off tall buildings, increasing the pressure on neighboring buildings’ windows and walls. The result can blow out glass and chip off facade. Even buildings designed to survive hurricanes can suffer major damage in a downburst. As engineers, we study downbursts with the goal of designing buildings, components such as solar panels and windows, and infrastructure such as power lines that can stand up to that powerful force. To do this, informed by field measurements, we create our own powerful downbursts using a hurricane simulator known as the Wall of Wind at Florida International University.
