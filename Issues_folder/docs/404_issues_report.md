## Detailed Analysis

### Athletics Files

A sample analysis of Athletics files revealed:

- All files have proper frontmatter with URL and title
- All files are from the domain `fiusports.com`
- Average content size is very small (around 300 bytes)
- The main issue is insufficient content extraction

The fiusports.com website appears to be a JavaScript-heavy site that our crawler struggled with. The pages were detected and metadata was properly extracted, but the actual content was not successfully retrieved.

### MainSite Files

The MainSite directory contains files mostly from the main FIU website (www.fiu.edu). Similar to Athletics, these files have proper metadata but insufficient content, suggesting JavaScript rendering issues.

### Calendar Files

The Calendar_Dynamic directory contains files related to event pages that may have:
- Dynamic content loading via JavaScript
- Event pages that have expired or been removed
- Calendar API endpoints that require authentication

## Common Issues Identified

1. **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: Many pages require client-side JavaScript execution to render content, which basic HTTP crawlers cannot handle.

2. **Authentication Required**: Some resources may require login or special permissions.

3. **Expired Content**: Particularly for calendar events, some content may no longer be available.

4. **Resource Files**: Some URLs point to non-HTML resources (images, PDFs, etc.) that were attempted to be processed as HTML.

5. **URL Structure Changes**: The site structure may have changed between the time the URLs were discovered and when they were crawled.

## Recommendations for Future Crawling

### 1. Use Headless Browser for JavaScript-Heavy Sites

```python
# Example with Playwright
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def crawl_with_playwright(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(url, wait_until="networkidle")
        content = page.content()
        browser.close()
        return content
```

### 2. Implement Domain-Specific Crawlers

Create specialized crawlers for different domains:

- **fiusports.com**: Use headless browser with longer wait times
- **fiu.edu**: Handle different content types appropriately
- **calendar.fiu.edu**: Use event-specific extraction logic

### 3. Add Better Error Handling and Retry Logic

```python
def crawl_with_retries(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.text
            elif response.status_code == 404:
                logger.warning(f"Page not found: {url}")
                return None
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error crawling {url}: {str(e)}")
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    return None
```

### 4. Implement Content Validation

Add checks to ensure meaningful content was extracted:

```python
def validate_content(html_content):
    # Remove HTML tags for text-only analysis
    text_content = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', html_content)
    text_content = text_content.strip()
    
    # Check content size
    if len(text_content) < 500:
        return False, "Content too small"
        
    # Check for error messages
    for error_pattern in ERROR_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(error_pattern, text_content, re.IGNORECASE):
            return False, f"Error pattern found: {error_pattern}"
            
    return True, "Content valid"
```

### 5. Use Site Maps When Available

For sites with sitemaps, prioritize crawling those URLs:

```python
import requests
from xml.etree import ElementTree

def get_sitemap_urls(sitemap_url):
    response = requests.get(sitemap_url)
    root = ElementTree.fromstring(response.content)
    urls = []
    for url in root.findall('.//{http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9}url'):
        loc = url.find('{http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9}loc')
        if loc is not None:
            urls.append(loc.text)
    return urls
```

## Conclusion

The high percentage of problematic files (69.97%) indicates significant challenges in crawling the FIU websites, primarily due to JavaScript-heavy content and dynamic loading. By implementing the recommendations above, particularly using headless browsers for JavaScript rendering and adding better content validation, we can significantly improve the quality of crawled content in future runs.
