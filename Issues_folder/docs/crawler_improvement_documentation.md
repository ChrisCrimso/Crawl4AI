# FIU Web Crawler Improvement Documentation

## Original Crawler Issues

The original crawler for Florida International University (FIU) websites encountered significant issues with certain types of content, particularly JavaScript-heavy websites. Analysis identified 2,708 problematic files, representing 69.97% of all crawled files. The main issues included:

1. **Content Too Small (75%)**: The crawler could extract metadata but failed to retrieve actual content from JavaScript-rendered pages
2. **Page Not Found Errors (24%)**: The crawler encountered 404 errors or couldn't properly access certain pages
3. **Other Errors (1%)**: Various technical issues including timeouts and parsing errors

The most problematic content was from:
- Athletics website (fiusports.com) - 61% of all problematic files
- Main FIU website - 24% of problematic files
- Calendar system - 14% of problematic files

## Technical Setup

### Requirements

The improved crawler requires the following dependencies (specified in `requirements_crawler.txt`):
- playwright >= 1.35.0
- tqdm >= 4.66.1
- beautifulsoup4 >= 4.12.0
- requests >= 2.31.0
- python-dotenv >= 1.0.0

### Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements_crawler.txt
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

### Project Structure

- **playwright_crawler.py**: The main crawler implementation using Playwright
- **compare_crawls.py**: Tool to compare original and recrawled content
- **requirements_crawler.txt**: Dependencies for the project
- **404_issues/**: Directory containing the problematic files from the original crawler
- **recrawled_content/**: Output directory for the new crawled content
- **comparison_results/**: Directory containing comparison reports

## Solution Approach

To address these issues, we developed an improved crawler using Playwright, a browser automation library that can handle JavaScript-heavy websites by fully rendering pages in a headless browser environment. The solution consisted of:

1. **Playwright Crawler (`playwright_crawler.py`)**:
   - Uses headless browser automation to render JavaScript-based content
   - Captures both HTML content and visual screenshots
   - Configurable wait times and timeouts to handle slow-loading sites
   - Comprehensive metadata preservation

2. **Comparison Tool (`compare_crawls.py`)**:
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of the improved crawler
   - Compares original problematic files with newly crawled versions
   - Generates detailed HTML and JSON reports with statistics
   - Includes visual comparisons via screenshots

## Implementation Details

The Playwright-based crawler offers several key improvements:

1. **Browser Automation**: Uses Chromium (can also use Firefox or WebKit) to fully render pages including JavaScript content
2. **Customizable Options**:
   - Configurable wait times after page load
   - Network idle detection
   - Custom timeout values
   - User agent configuration to avoid bot detection
3. **Rich Output**:
   - Full HTML content extraction
   - Automatic screenshot capture
   - Comprehensive metadata preservation
   - Structured storage of crawled content

### Visual Comparison Reports

The comparison tool generates comprehensive HTML reports that include:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Overall success rates and content improvement metrics
2. **Content Comparisons**: Side-by-side comparison of original vs. recrawled content length
3. **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots of successfully crawled pages, providing visual confirmation of the content captured
4. **Error Analysis**: Details of failed crawls with error messages for further debugging

These reports are automatically generated after each crawling session and stored in the `comparison_results` directory, making it easy to track improvements and identify remaining issues.

## Testing Methodology

We conducted tests on problematic URLs from the Athletics directory (fiusports.com), which represented the majority of crawling issues:

1. Selected a sample of URLs from different content categories (player profiles, news articles, galleries, etc.)
2. Applied the Playwright crawler with various configurations
3. Generated comparison reports to measure improvements
4. Analyzed patterns in successful vs. failed crawls

### Usage Example

To test the crawler on a sample of URLs from the Athletics directory:
```
python playwright_crawler.py --sample 5 --wait 8 --timeout 60000
```

To compare the results with the original files:
```
python compare_crawls.py
```

## Results

### Overall Success Rate

The Playwright-based crawler achieved a **66.7% success rate** (12 out of 18 files) on previously problematic URLs, a significant improvement over the original crawler that failed on all of these files.

### Content Improvement

For successfully crawled pages, we observed:
- Average content length improvement: **6,032%**
- Maximum improvement: **26,488%** (baseball statistics page)
- Minimum improvement for successful crawls: **895%**

### Content Types Successfully Crawled

The improved crawler was particularly effective for:
- Player profiles and team rosters
- Game box scores and statistics
- News articles
- Image galleries
- Team schedules

### Examples of Dramatic Improvements

| Content Type | Original Length | New Length | Improvement |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Baseball Box Score | 85 chars | 22,600 chars | 26,488% |
| Basketball News Article | 85 chars | 6,836 chars | 7,942% |
| Player Profile | 85 chars | 4,429 chars | 5,110% |
| Team Schedule | 85 chars | 5,941 chars | 6,889% |

## Remaining Challenges

Despite significant improvements, some challenges remain:

1. **Timeout Issues** (33.3% of crawls):
   - Some pages still fail with "Page.goto: Timeout exceeded" errors
   - Particularly problematic for news articles and video content
   
2. **Content-Specific Challenges**:
   - Video content consistently failed to crawl properly
   - Some complex JavaScript interactions remain difficult to handle

## Further Improvements

Based on the testing results, several potential improvements could be made:

1. **Enhanced Timeout Handling**:
   - Implement adaptive timeouts based on content type
   - Add retry mechanisms with incremental backoff
   - Consider parallel crawling with different timeout configurations

2. **Content-Specific Handlers**:
   - Develop specialized handlers for video content
   - Implement custom interaction sequences for complex JavaScript pages
   - Add support for cookie/session handling

3. **Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Implement browser context reuse to improve performance
   - Add batch processing capabilities
   - Develop intelligent scheduling based on site responsiveness

## Conclusion

The Playwright-based crawler represents a substantial improvement over the original crawler, successfully extracting content from 66.7% of previously problematic pages with an average content improvement of over 6,000%. While challenges remain with certain content types, particularly video and complex JavaScript applications, the approach has proven effective for most content on the Athletics website.

This improved methodology could be expanded to handle the remaining problematic files across all FIU websites, significantly enhancing the comprehensiveness and quality of the crawled content used in knowledge base systems.
