Yes/No If yes- Students will check a box(es) indicating that they need support with a COA category (Food, Housing, tuition, etc.) and they will get the max COA cost for that category. Initial awards will be based on the COA costs they indicate up to a total award of 1,200 per student. Students may request additional assistance as needed (process outlined below).
Cost of AttendanceLiving Expenses per semester| UGRD| GRAD  
---|---|---  
Housing| 1,532| 3,064  
Food| 1,264| 1,264  
Medical| 193.33| 193.33

Students can select how they wish their grant to be applied by answering the question: I authorize FIU to apply federal student emergency funds directly to my account.
I have the right to decline any emergency aid be applied to my student account to pay off debts. I may instead use the funds for any component of your cost of attendance or for emergency costs that arise due to coronavirus. (eg. tuition, food, housing, health care, mental health care, or childcare)
    * Yes- please apply funds directly to my balance and refund any difference to me.
    * No- please refund funds directly to me.
In accordance with HEERF guidance students with exceptional need (pell eligible) and domestic students are prioritized. Students who have additional need beyond the initial award can submit additional requests with documentation confirming need/expenses and be considered for more funding. Total HEERF 3 student emergency grants per student will not exceed the **pell max (6,495)**. If a student has already received the max HEERF 3 student emergency grant amount they may be evaluated for support from other available sources. Additional funds will be awarded based on the same hierarchy with priority (above) and based on funding availability.
Financial aid administrators may exercise professional judgment in making awards and assisting students who have extenuating circumstances which warrant a reevaluation of their emergency aid award.

### FAQs
**How can students apply for funds?**
Students can apply for funds by completing an application at go.fiu.edu/eaidrequest.
**Who is eligible for these funds?**
Students who are or were enrolled at FIU during the COVID-19 national emergency (March 13, 2020-present). This includes citizens, permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, other DREAMers, and similar undocumented students. International students may also receive HEERF. (Transient non-degree students will be funded by their home institution).
**I applied for CARES Act /CRRSAA funds and did not receive an award. Should I apply again?**
Yes! This is a new set of funds.
**What are the types of expenses covered by this funding?**
These grants may be used for support expenses relating to any component of the student’s cost to attend school (tuition, books, educational materials) or for emergency costs that arose due to the coronavirus (such as food, housing, healthcare or childcare).
**If I applied before and received funds, do I need to apply again to get additional funds? Or is it automatic?**
It is not automatic. If you applied and received CARES/CRRSAA funds previously, you still need to apply again for funds from ARP. These are new funds that require a separate application. Funds will not be awarded automatically.
**How can I help/donate additional funds to help students?**
The Panther Protection Fund assists students facing difficulties threatening to interrupt their education. Grants cover needs not covered by other resources, including tuition, temporary housing, living expenses, food and car repairs.
The FIUstrong Fund supports the greatest emergency needs of students, faculty and staff when other funding options cannot meet their specific needs. You can give to either fund.
**I received an award but I still have need. What can I do?**
Students who have exceptional additional need can submit additional e-aid requests with documentation confirming additional need/expenses and be considered for more funding. Additional funding is not guaranteed.
**Is there a cap on how much I can get from ARP?**
Yes - Total ARP student emergency grants per student will not exceed the pell max (6,495) per aid year/funding source. If a student has already received the max ARP student emergency grant amount they may be evaluated for support from other available sources, based on availability. Additional funding is not guaranteed.
