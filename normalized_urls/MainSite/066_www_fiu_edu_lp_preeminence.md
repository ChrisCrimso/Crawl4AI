## What does _preeminence_ mean for you?
$25M New Recurring Funding
Preeminence is a great honor, but it also brings with it increased support from the State of Florida. $25 million in funding with possibly more in the years to come creates new opportunities for students, faculty and staff alike.

### Improving the FIU experience
New funding means a better FIU for our students, including more advisors, state-of-the-art learning equipment and career-readiness resources.
Once our FIU students become FIU graduates, their diplomas from a preeminent university will not go unnoticed, making strong resumes even stronger in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
