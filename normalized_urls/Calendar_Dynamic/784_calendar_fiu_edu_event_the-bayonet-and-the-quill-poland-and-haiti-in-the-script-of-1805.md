Set in the Design Gallery alongside the _Creole Archive Project: Poloné Nwa - Constitution 1805_ exhibition, this thought-provoking panel discussion brings together Haitian-born American artist Edouard Duval-Carrié and FIU’s Ratcliffe Art + Design Incubator Director and Professor of Art + Art History Jacek Kolasiński. The conversation delves into the complex history and cultural legacy of the 1805 alliance between Polish legionnaires and Haitian revolutionaries. Through art, archival research, and storytelling, the discussion offers insight into a little-known chapter of global resistance and solidarity during Haiti’s fight for independence.
