This intermediate-level online workshop is designed for faculty seeking to thoughtfully integrate artificial intelligence into their teaching practices to enhance both course design and student engagement. Led by Marc Weinstein, CAT AI Faculty Fellow, the session will provide participants with evidence-based approaches to leveraging AI tools for curriculum development, instructional innovation, and pedagogical efficiency.
Building on foundational AI knowledge, the workshop will examine practical applications of AI for streamlining course preparation, generating instructional content, fostering active learning, and facilitating timely, personalized feedback. Special emphasis will be placed on aligning AI-enhanced practices with sound pedagogical principles and maintaining academic integrity.
Participants will engage in critical discussions on the ethical and responsible use of AI in higher education, explore case studies, and gain hands-on experience with AI-driven tools that support student-centered learning. By the conclusion of the workshop, faculty will have developed actionable strategies for enhancing teaching effectiveness and enriching the student learning experience.
**Prerequisite:** A basic familiarity with AI tools or prior participation in an introductory AI in teaching workshop is recommended.
