The Ocean Awards Reception is a new part of Capitol Hill Ocean Week that creates an energizing and fun soirée to meet, mingle and celebrate champions of our ocean and Great Lakes. The reception is the place to network with colleagues old and new, luminaries in the ocean community, and the business leaders and policymakers that are invested in our waters.
This standing reception is a fantastic opportunity to form partnerships with shared missions, host clients, gather with friends, broaden networks, enjoy sustainable US seafood and most importantly – celebrate our collective commitment to improving the health of our ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes and the communities that depend upon them.
This year, the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation will honor Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) for their ocean leadership at the Ocean Awards Reception!
