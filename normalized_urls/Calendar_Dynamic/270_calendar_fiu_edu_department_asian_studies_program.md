# Asian Studies Program
Starting with a small certificate program that did not have a language requirement, we now have a vigorous program of Chinese and Japanese studies that supports the Master's and Bachelor's degree as well as a variety of advanced certificates and a minor. Through networking with K-12 schools, businesses, and community organizations, Asian Studies participates in a wide range of outreach activities.
