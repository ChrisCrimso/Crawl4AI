Program Description
The major in International Relations provides a broad, interdisciplinary education that will equip students for a wide variety of careers. Many of our students have gone on to excel in public service, including careers with local, state, and national governments, and with international and non-governmental organizations. Others have entered the private sector in fields as diverse as banking and finance, consulting, business, journalism, law, marketing, and higher education. The curriculum is designed to expose students to topics that cut across a range of disciplines while also allowing specialization in a student's area of interest.
