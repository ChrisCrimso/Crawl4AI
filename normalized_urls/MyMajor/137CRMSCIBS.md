Program Description
Crime Science combines forensics and computer science with traditional criminology and criminal justice. It is interdisciplinary involving law, the social and behavioral sciences, crime, the reaction of society to the crime problem, and the means used in treating it. The program produces graduates with sophisticated analytical skills needed for a new era of law enforcement.
The BS in Crime Science is intended for students who appreciate the modern complexities of crime, its prevention and control. Contemporary concerns over homeland security has created an unprecedented demand for criminal justice and counter terrorism have also created new technological problems and demands for police agencies, as has the growth of computer-related crime. Internship opportunities are plentiful for undergraduate students and students can be placed in numerous local, state and federal agencies. The Bachelor of Science in Criminal Science is offered both onsite and fully online.
