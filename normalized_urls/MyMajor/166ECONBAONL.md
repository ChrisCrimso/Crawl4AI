Program Description
The Economics degree provides students with an understanding of economic problems and institutions and with analytical tools to apply this knowledge to contemporary problems. The program stresses the analytical and quantitative skills necessary for today's jobs and is designed for students desiring a career in business, government, international agencies, or multinational corporations and for those planning graduate study in economics, business, law, public administration, urban studies, or international relations. The degree is a strong choice for those interested in pursuing an advanced degree (such as an MBA or a law degree), learning more about financial markets, or better understanding the ever-changing global environment. Employers looking to hire in financial institutions or consulting firms often consider economics to be an extremely attractive major.
