Program Description
The Biological Sciences degree program provides a strong foundation in biology, from molecules to ecosystems, including structural and developmental biology, physiology, organismal diversity, and ecology, within an evolutionary framework. Faculty and students work with a diverse array of plant, animal, and microbial organisms and in a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. FIU is ideally situated for the study of tropical biology and many of our laboratories specialize in tropical systems. This field of study will prepare students for further graduate and professional studies, as well as for employment in areas that require university-level training in the life sciences. A Biology Education track prepares students for teaching at the secondary level.
