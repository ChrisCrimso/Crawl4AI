Program Description
Criminal Justice focuses on formal mechanisms of social control by which society exercises constraint over its members. It is interdisciplinary involving law, the social and behavioral sciences, crime, the reaction of society to the crime problem, and the means used in treating it. The study of criminal justice fills the needs of students seeking careers in law and within the various agencies of the criminal justice system. The growing emphasis on homeland security has created an unprecedented demand for criminal justice and security professionals. Internship opportunities are plentiful for undergraduate students and students can be placed in numerous local, state and federal agencies. The Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice is offered both onsite and fully online.
