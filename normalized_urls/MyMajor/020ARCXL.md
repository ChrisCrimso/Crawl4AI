Campus:
Modesto Maidique Campus
Program Description
The accelerated Master of Architecture program provides a seamless course of study that begins freshman year with pre-graduate studies, commences graduate studies in the third year, and leads to the conferral of the Professional Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch). The program is centered on an exciting sequence of design studios that leads the student from the basics of design through advanced architectural projects that explore structure, materials, building systems, site conditions, history/theory, digital design, and cultural context. Students are encouraged to study abroad in our Genoa center, take classes at our Miami Beach Urban Studio, and explore related fields in the College. Architects enjoy work in the private and public sectors and contribute in numerous ways to our built environment.
Admission Requirements
1. Students entering FIU as Freshmen
You are considered a freshman when you have earned less the 13 college credits since your high school graduation. Credits earned in Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs do not affect your freshman status.
The professional design majors are Selective Admissions programs. Students must meet the general FIU criteria for students entering with fewer than 60 approved credits, [Click here for the details](http://admissions.fiu.edu/apply/freshman/), and must also submit a portfolio for evaluation by the School of Architecture. [Click Here](http://soa.fiu.edu/applyarchitecture.htm) to see more specifics on the selective admissions process.
As the portfolio review process is underway, students will be housed temporarily in [Undergraduate Education](http://undergrad.fiu.edu/) pending their decision.
2. Transfer students entering FIU with 60 or more earned, approved credits
Transfer applicants must meet FIU admissions criteria, must have completed the AA in their design major and participate in a portfolio review process. [Click Here](http://soa.fiu.edu/applyarchitecture.htm) to see more specifics on the program's admissions process.
