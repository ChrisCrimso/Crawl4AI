Program Description
Civil Engineering is the oldest of the engineering disciplines. It involves the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of buildings, highways, railways, bridges, airports, seaports, and other structures of modern society. Given the global need for rebuilding, maintaining and further developing infrastructures, the demand for civil engineers has never been greater. Civil engineers can choose from a broad spectrum of career opportunities in industry, government and private consulting. Our program provides a background of interrelated sub-disciplines of Civil Engineering with the fundamental core subjects of the engineering program. The curriculum consists of 129 credits hours, including technical courses in the areas of construction, geotechnical, environmental, structural, surveying, transportation, and water resources engineering.
