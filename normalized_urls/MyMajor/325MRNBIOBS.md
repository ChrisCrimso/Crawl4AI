Program Description
The Marine Biology degree program provides a strong foundation in biology, including structural and developmental biology, physiology, organismal diversity, and ecology, within an evolutionary framework. Housed at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the program focuses on marine organisms and ecosystems, taking advantage of ready access to the diverse tropical marine environments of South Florida and the Caribbean, including coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds. Faculty and students strive to enhance our understanding and stewardship of the world's oceans, especially coastal ecosystems. This field of study will prepare students for further graduate and professional studies, as well as for employment in areas that require university-level training in marine biology and oceanography.
