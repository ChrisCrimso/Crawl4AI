Program Description
The BA in Geography educates students in the study of the spatial patterns of human interactions with natural and built environments. Geography includes regional studies, and many students become experts in Latin America, Asia, Africa, or other world regions. Geographers confront real world problems including the causes and consequences of climate change, racial and ethnic segregation in cities, conflicts over boundaries and territories, industrial location, and agriculture production and food distribution, to name only a few. Graduates will find employment opportunities in a wide variety of careers in the public, private, and non-profit sectors. Students acquire a global perspective and valuable skills including social survey techniques, ethnography, social statistical sampling methods, computerized social data analysis, and computer-based mapping of social phenomena.
