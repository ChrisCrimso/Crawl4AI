Sociology/Anthropology - Sociology (Online),
BA
Green Sch of Intl & Public Aff
Campus:
Fully Online
Program Description
The BA in Sociology/Anthropology allows students to concentrate in either sociology or anthropology. The sociology track educates students in the scientific study of social life. Sociologists confront real world problems such as the effects on social life resulting from corporate downsizing, the growth of web-based and mobile technologies, or urban blight and gentrification. The anthropology track educates students in the study of the cultural practices in particular places; how people organize, govern, and create meaning. Anthropologists work on problems such as the cross-cultural delivery of health care, exclusion or assimilation of immigrant populations. Students acquire a global perspective and valuable skills including social survey techniques, ethnography, social statistical sampling methods, computerized social data analysis, and computer-based mapping of social phenomena.
