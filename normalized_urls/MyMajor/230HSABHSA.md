Program Description
The Bachelor of Health Services Administration (BHSA) qualifies graduates for entry-level management positions in health services delivery organizations providing acute and chronic care, rehabilitation and/or health promotion in various health care settings. This degree is a valuable career development pathway for students licensed/certified in clinical health sciences professions but lacking an undergraduate degree; this degree also prepares students for further study at the graduate level in health services administration, public health, and other health science professions (e.g., Athletic Training, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Language Pathology) given students complete the prerequisite science courses. The program emphasizes systems engineering and financial management of health organizations, health services research, economics, politics and legal aspects of health systems, and program planning and evaluation.
