Program Description
The Spanish major presents a program of study that helps non-native speakers to achieve mastery of the language and provides an opportunity for native speakers to fully develop correctness in its use. The program educates students in language, literature, linguistics and Latin American and Spanish cultures. The department offers a very successful Summer program in Spain, which attracts students from all disciplines. Spanish majors are fully prepared to enter graduate programs in Spanish Literature and Linguistics as well as teach at the high school level. Likewise a second major or minor in Spanish leads to many opportunities in commerce, hospitality and business in Florida and abroad and is ideal for students in International Relations or Government.
