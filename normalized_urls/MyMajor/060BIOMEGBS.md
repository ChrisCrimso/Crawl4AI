Program Description
The Biomedical Engineering (BME) program is leading the State in Biomedical Engineering education. It is the only department in the nation offering an accredited undergraduate degree in BME at a Minority and Hispanic serving institution. Biomedical Engineering weaves a strong life science foundation with multidisciplinary engineering fundamentals for investigating and understanding living system using quantitative assessment tools, engineering living systems, and developing novel biomedical sensors and devices. The objective of the undergraduate program is to produce graduates that continue in advanced study in engineering, medicine or the sciences and/or professional practice as a biomedical engineer in industry. Biomedical Engineering students are trained to demonstrate proficiency in one or more of the following areas: clinical application of biomedical engineering tools, product development, manufacturing, and commercialization in the biomedical industry; participation in diverse teams; and biomedical research. Our graduates are also prepared to meet their professional responsibilities by providing service to the community through leadership skills, ethical decision making and effective communication.
