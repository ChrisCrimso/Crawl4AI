Program Description
Knowledge of Earth Sciences is essential for understanding problems of climate change, groundwater supply, weather and environmental hazards, geotechnical engineering, and natural resource management. Students have the opportunity to work in well-equipped Earth Science laboratories and to learn the major techniques used in the Earth Sciences, including meteorology, hydrogeology, oceanography and geology. The Bachelors of Arts in Earth Sciences provides Earth Science background for those who intend to enter fields, such as public administration, law, and especially teaching. The Earth Science Education major offers a degree in the discipline with multiple field experiences in diverse classroom settings and culminates in a full-time teaching internship. Upon graduation from the program, students are endorsed for Full Teacher Certification by the State of Florida’s Department of Education
Admission Requirements
1. Students entering FIU as Freshmen or as a Transfer Student with less than 60 credits:
You are considered a freshman when you have earned less than 13 college credits since your high school graduation. Credits earned in Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate programs do not affect your freshman status.
Students entering with fewer than 60 approved credits must meet the general FIU criteria. Click here for the details.
In addition, secondary education majors are limited access majors with specific requirements established by the State of Florida Department of Education. Students wishing to enroll in a teacher preparation program must maintain a 2.5 GPA. Additionally, students must take and pass all four sections of the General Knowledge Test (Mathematics, Reading Comprehension, English Language Skills, and Essay) within the first 60 credits. These requirements must be met before a student can be fully admitted into a teacher preparation program that results in endorsement for full teacher certification. Please see the Secondary Education Advisor for more details (305-348-2978).
2. Students transferring to FIU with 60 or more earned, approved credits:

- Minimum 2.5 GPA (based on a 4.0 scale) in lower-division coursework
