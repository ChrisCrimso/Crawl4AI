The Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME) at Florida International University (FIU) offers a curriculum which is designed to give the student a thorough understanding of the basic laws of science and advanced analysis and design skills to stimulate and develop creative thinking, a professional attitude, economic judgment and environmental consciousness. The aim is to develop the students' potential to the fullest, to prepare the students for superior performance as mechanical engineers, and to provide the students with the fundamental principles necessary for pursuing advanced study in the diverse fields of engineering, science and business. Students are given a good grounding in fluid/thermal sciences and energy systems, mechanics and materials, robotics and manufacturing, and computational methods.
