### John Wolin Scholarship (Journalism + Media)
This endowment scholarship fund was established in 2007 by Mrs. Wolin as a memorial to her husband, John Wolin, who loved journalism and teaching young journalists how to polish their craft. Wolin was a reporter and editor at the Miami Herald for 21 years, who inspired readers by chronicling his experiences as an achondroplastic dwarf.
