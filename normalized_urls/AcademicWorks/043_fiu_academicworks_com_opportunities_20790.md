### Willie E. Williams Scholarship
Dr. Willie E. Williams began his career at FIU as a professor of mathematical sciences when FIU was still in its infancy and received many awards for his innovative teaching techniques. He was a champion for all children and worked tirelessly to build the mathematical skills of many of Miami’s disadvantaged youth by tutoring them on the evenings and weekends. Dr. Williams was an ardent supporter of human rights for all citizens of Dade County. He was often called upon by civic and community leaders to resolve conflicts and to assist in developing programs that would empower the socially and economically disadvantaged.
The Willie E. Williams Award was established in 1995 to recognize the contributions of students who had excelled in utilizing positive and pro-active communications in the community and in academia.
