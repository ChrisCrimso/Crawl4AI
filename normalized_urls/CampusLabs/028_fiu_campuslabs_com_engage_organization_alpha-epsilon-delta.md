## About
The mission of the Society is to encourage and recognize excellence in pre-health scholarship; to stimulate an appreciation of the importance of pre-health education; to promote communication between health profession and pre-health students and educators; to provide a forum for students with common interests; and to use its resources to benefit health organizations, charities and the community. We give our members the ability to gain experience, practice and develop the skills necessary for all disciplines in diverse fields of healthcare such as medical, nursing, dental, pharmaceutical, occupational therapy, etc. through shadowing and research opportunities, workshops, community service, professional development seminars, and more.
To clarify, this isn't a Greek sorority or fraternity. We are open to all fields in healthcare studies such as medical, dental, pharmaceutical, physical therapy, nursing, occupational therapy, and veterinarian.
