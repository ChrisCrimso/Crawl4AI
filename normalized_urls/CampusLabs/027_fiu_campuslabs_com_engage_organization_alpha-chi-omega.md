## About
Membership in Alpha Chi Omega at FIU combines the best of all worlds: the privilege and leadership opportunities of membership and the fun of a fully developed calendar that includes philanthropy and social events. For Alpha Chi Omegas, sisterhood and friendship are one and the same. We recruit real, genuine women interested in lasting friendship. Best of all, our sisterhood extends well beyond the collegiate experience. We’ve initiated more than 200,000 women over the years…that’s an amazing network of friends, sisters, and mentors that will support our FIU chapter for a long, long time.
