## Description
The Office of Veteran and Military Affairs at FIU hosts a heartfelt Memorial Day Remembrance Ceremony to honor brave men and women who sacrificed their lives in military service. The ceremony includes a wreath-laying at the Felsberg Veterans Plaza, a site specifically recognizing veterans and fallen heroes. This year, the ceremony will also honor the late Professor Patrick "Chip" Cassidy, a distinguished FIU faculty member and Vietnam War veteran, known for his contributions to the university and service to the country. This solemn occasion offers the FIU community an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices made for our freedom and to express gratitude to those who have served.
