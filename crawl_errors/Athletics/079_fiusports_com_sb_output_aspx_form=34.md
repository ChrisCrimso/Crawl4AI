  20. **FIU Mascot & Spirit Team Appearances - Procedures & Protocols** Sprit teams and mascot appearances are available upon request with a **MINIMUM TWO-WEEK notice**. Due to the time demands on our student performers, we cannot guarantee that each requested appearance will be fulfilled. Furthermore, priority will be given to athletics-related and University duties. FIU Athletics reserves the right to refuse any appearance. All requests will be left to the discretion of the FIU Athletics Department. The Athletics Department will decide if any appearance conflicts with the best interest of the Departement, its student-athletes, and/or coaches. For appearances taking place outside of the South Florida community, all expenses must be paid for by the requesting organization. Please allow more than ample time for arrangements to be made for "out-of-the-ordinary" travel. REFUNDS: There are NO refund for cancellations with less than 24 hours notice, including bad weather. Roary and Spirit Team members will be prepared based upon the details that are provided in the form. Please be VERY clear about your expectations of the team's role at your event. Appearances are non-performance events. Non-performance activities might include a meet and greet, photos with event guests, autograph signings, or handing out event giveaways. If alcohol is being served while Roary and/or Spirit Team members are at your event, they must be stationed away from the area where it is being served. Also, please note that if guests become rowdy or inappropriate, these students are instructed to leave immediately and no refund will be provided. Appearances will require a PRIVATE changing room away from guests and a place where the mascot and/or Spirit Teams' belongings can be stored during the event. Bathrooms are NOT acceptable. **ROARY SPECIFIC NOTES:** Roary will arrive 15 minutes prior to the start time in order to change into costume. **Please note that outdoor events require that Roary takes a 10-minute break every 20 minutes, and/or as needed.** Appropriate parking arrangements must be made for all performers, including reimbursement or advance payment accomodations. Spirit groups are expected to car pool when necessary, so as to cut down on additional costs for the requesting organization. Water MUST be provided to ALL performers at ALL events. For events lasting longer than two (2) hours and/or taking place during "normal" meal hours, it is highly recommended that reasonable refreshments be provided for the performers, especially in the case of events taking place outdoors.
