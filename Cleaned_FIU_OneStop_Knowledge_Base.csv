The Panther Book Pack is a new university-wide initiative that targets textbook affordability and student success This innovative program is expected to save students thirty to fifty percent (30% to 50%) on the rental of required course materials in undergraduate courses It will also create equitable access to materials for all students, ensuring availability by the first day of class.

  * [Why doesn't FIU work directly with publishers?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10190-3)
Publishers do not offer all the different formats of content that faculty request at the lowest price possible Barnes & Noble provides a central platform for faculty adoptions of course materials as well as a central e-commerce and digital platform for delivery of these course materials to students.

FIU and Barnes & Noble fully support and encourage the selection of OER no-cost and low-cost solutions but the selection of such materials remains a faculty decision These resources are considered when calculating the per credit cost of the Panther Book Pack FIU was able to achieve such a lost cost per credit hour, in part, because of the significant efforts made by our faculty to adopt no-cost or low-cost materials.

  * [How can I be sure that this will lower my overall course materials costs?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10389-24)
FIU is committed to providing affordable course materials and ensuring equitable access to course materials for our students We understand that there isn’t one solution that will work for all students all the time However, after much analysis, we deem that the Panther Book Pack rental program offers the greatest savings to the majority of our undergraduate students most of the time.
We urge you to compare the cost of purchasing your course materials independently versus paying $20 per undergraduate credit hour each session You should also consider other program benefits of the Panther Book Pack in your analysis, such as guaranteed delivery of required course materials on or before the first day of class by a single vendor Ultimately, each student should determine what the best option is each term This program is intended to offer the most affordable and equitable access option for most.
  * [Do I have to participate?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10389-25)

  * [Will I receive a hard copy book or a digital book for my course through the Panther Book Pack?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10389-26)
It depends on the instructor’s preference The instructor selects the required format in which the course materials should be used by the students If an instructor adopts an e-book, that is what will be included in the Panther Book Pack If an instructor selects a hard copy, then that is what will be included in the Panther Book Pack.
  * [What course materials are excluded from the Panther Book Pack?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10389-27)

Your personalized verification email from Barnes & Noble will outline any exclusions form the Panther Book Pack.
  * [Why am I being charged for the Panther Book Pack for a course that does not have any course materials?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/frequently-asked-questions/#panel-N10389-28)
For the lowest institutional per-credit flat rate, all undergraduate courses must participate in the program Courses with no required course materials, or course materials that are low- or no-cost to you, will all be part of the Panther Book Pack program and you will be charged the flat rate of $20 per credit hour By the same token, for courses with very expensive materials or multiple required materials you will also only be charged the flat rate of $20 per credit hour Under this subscription model, this should balance out and ultimately pass on significant savings to you across multiple courses However, if the $20 flat rate is not the most affordable option when looking at your total cost for the term, you may opt out of the Panther Book Pack program for that term but will be responsible for obtaining the required course materials on your own.

# ![Panther Bookpack](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/bookpack.png)
Starting Fall 2021, the Panther Book Pack is an affordable course materials rental program providing all undergraduate students with their required course materials by the first day of class at a fixed rate of $20.50 per credit hour Students are estimated to save as much as $375 on course materials per semester with the Panther Book Pack program.
## How it Works
  * [Register For Classes](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N101A1-1)
  * [Verify Your Order](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N101A1-2)
  * [Receive Your Textbooks](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N101A1-3)


Upon registering for courses, you will be automatically enrolled into the program and the bookstore will start preparing your order A charge of $20.50 per credit hour will be applied to your FIU student account along with your tuition.
Approximately 30 days before the first day of classes, you will receive an email that summarizes your required and recommended course materials and prompts you to select your fulfillment preference (options may include pick-up on campus, shipping to an off-campus address, and direct digital access in Canvas).
An email notification will be sent when your order is ready for pickup or when it ships Your digital materials will be accessible in your course(s) within Canvas.
## The Benefits
The Panther Book Pack program gives you convenient access to all of your course materials.
  * Receive all your course materials by the first day of class
  * Save 35-50% on the cost of your required course materials each term
  * Benefit from highly personalized service from our on-campus bookstore staff
  * Plan ahead with more ease and less stress because you know the cost of your course materials for every term based on the number of credits you register for
  * Save time – we negotiated the low rate of $20.50 per credit for you so that you don’t have to shop around for low price


## Participation
![](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/bookpack_tile.png)
Any student who would like to check on their participation status and qualifying classes for the Panther Book Pack can do so at MyFIU on the Panther Book Pack tile.
While you are automatically enrolled for the Panther Book Pack at the time that you register for classes, you may opt out if you do not wish to participate We encourage you to compare pricing before you do Tally the cost of all your required course materials to make sure your total cost is not more than the Panther Book Pack’s $20.50 per credit hour.
If you’ve done the research and still don’t think that the Panther Book Pack is the right fit for you, you can opt out at any point from the day you receive your Panther Book Pack email until three days after the add/ drop date on the Academic Calendar for that term.
In order to see the actual cost of each required course material, input the data in the required fields for each course you are taking For the term, select the relevant term with the words ‘OPT OUT’ next to it This will populate the retail cost of all the course materials in all available formats, which may include new, used, rental, digital.
## How to Change Participation Status
  * [Step 1: Access MyFIU](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N106FB-1)
Log in to MyFIU using your FIU credentials and locate the Panther Book Pack tile toward the bottom of the page.
![Panther Book Pack tile circled on MyFIU dashboard](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/images/opt_out_1.png)
  * [Step 2: Manage Participation Status](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N106FB-2)
Find the session you are enrolled for and click the opt-out toggle switch on the right Students can click on the session to see all the classes they're registered for in that session If you're taking multiple sessions in a semester you must opt-out from each independently Students can use this toggle switch to opt-out or opt-in any time before the deadline Once you have done so click ""Save Changes"" on the top right of the page.
![](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/images/opt_out_3.png)
  * [Step 3: Finalizing Your Preferences](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/#panel-N106FB-3)
Once you have clicked ""Save Changes"" a pop up menu will ask you to confirm the selected option Students have until 3 days after the add/drop date to opt-out or opt back in, after the date your selection is considered finalized and will not be able to change We highly recommend you compare prices before finalizing this process.
